A creepy, claustrophobic atmosphere.
No longer a haunted house movie at all, but simply a collection of crummy shock scenes with absolutely no shock.
a quickie cash-in on both the early '80s revitalized 3-D craze and the success of the previous two Amityville films
It so utterly fails to articulate its threat that the scary stuff presumably facilitated by everyone's moronic behavior turns into a running joke.
Unlike the first two Amityville titles, this one makes no claim to authenticity, but such honesty doesn't save it from being a terrible movie.
Veteran director Richard Fleischer demonstrates a keen understanding of the potentials of the 3-D gimmick here, but there is little else to recommend this dull retread.
There is hardly anything original about the picture.
To pad things out characters argue over story-lines from previous Amityville movies, while for 3-D purposes, wasps, furniture and minor players are hurled in our direction at varying intervals.
3-D, the stamp of greatness...
Replaces derivation with gimmicks.
...presented in standard 2-D format and does not require special glasses to view. However, I don't see how wearing them can possibly hurt.
...thoroughly bereft of any interesting ideas, as evidenced by the film's absurdly underwhelming climax...
The cast is good, but the characters are idiots.
Entirely flat, despite the gimmicky effects
Works as well as a 3-D sequel of a sequel (starring Tony Roberts in the lead role) can posibly work. And that ain't well.
Better than the first two, but apart from the 3-D novelty not much





@highlight

A gimmicky Amityville retread with insufferable characters.
