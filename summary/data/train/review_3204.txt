Still the best action movie I've ever seen.
A gripping thriller.
...ultimately comes off as an above-average thriller that's elevated by the inclusion of several electrifying sequences and an expectedly charismatic turn from Steve McQueen.
The Getaway scores a triple play: It's a good character examination, a good relationship study, and a good action flick.
Relentlessly depicts ruthless robbery and murder, not to mention adultery, kidnaping, bribery, extortion, and general mayhem. The vivid direction and lightning pace, however, make the film completely fascinating.
Tough as nails and very effective.
The action and the violence of The Getaway are supported by no particular themes whatsoever. The movie just unravels.
simply too contrived to be taken seriously
It's like one of those devices for executive desks, with the stainless steel balls on the strings: It functions with great efficiency but doesn't accomplish anything.
A tough crime drama with a steely McQueen performance and the usual quota of Peckinpah violence.
A trashy good time!

The Getaway sees Sam Peckinpah and Steve McQueen, the kings of violence and cool, working at full throttle.
