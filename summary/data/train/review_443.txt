It's a teen thriller, practically aimed at that audience, but includes fights... bullying and, yes, a romantic story. [Full review in Spanish]
[The] positives aren't really enough to make iBoy feel like much more than another teen sci-fi. It's a thrill ride up to a point, but there are many films that do what it's doing better and with more heart.
Violent book-based thriller has cursing, mature themes.
iBoy is a fully charged superhero tale that soon overcomes its admittedly ludicrous premise.
The film's secret superhero is Maisie Williams as Lucy.
Even if this were the place to discuss such matters, director Adam Randall (adapting Kevin Brooks's novel) has little new to say.
iBoy is a sparky film, embedded in London's cheek-by-jowl world of wealth and poverty. It's also a dark teen drama, peppered with brutal beatings, gang rape, drugs and dead bodies.
There is a persistent and disconcerting joylessness about this.
Entertaining High-concept superhero movie with some glaring pacing issues.
iBoy has an original-enough concept, taken from a book by Kevin Brooks, but any freshness is muffled by the dated gangster movie clichés peppered throughout the script.
iBoy misses out on the opportunity for entertaining mischief with a po-faced approach to the material and a lack of internal logic to the story.

@highlight

iBoy 's original premise and Maisie Williams' strong performance aren't enough to overwrite a clichéd narrative, too-serious tone, and overall glitchy execution.
