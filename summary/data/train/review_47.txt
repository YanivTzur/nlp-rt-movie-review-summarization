...contains a terminally meandering midsection that ultimately drains the film of its energy and renders its positive attributes moot.
Witching & Bitching, Alex de la Iglesia's latest madcap genre mash-up, literally could not get past its opening scenes, much less to its ridiculous conclusion, without its characters doing the dumbest and most inexplicable things possible.
