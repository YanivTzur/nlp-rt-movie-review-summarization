Kick-Ass 2 actually develops its main characters, Hit Girl and Kick Ass, allowing them to grow up in ways that are surprisingly fun and interesting.
It is one big rollicking hot mess of a film, and I like it.
This is a very uneven film.
The only nice thing I can say about Kick-Ass 2 is that the score by Henry Jackman (Wreck-It Ralph) and Matthew Margeson (Skyline) was pretty cool. Other than that-gross.
While the character development and underlying premise of this installment are far more eloquently stated than they were in the first film, Kick-Ass 2, like its characters, suffers at times from a dual identity.
In trading a modestly subversive critique for a modestly successful romp, Kick-Ass 2 falls short of the expectations set by its predecessor.
Kick-Ass 2 is a giddy kind of ride, offering up well-designed action scenes and a few perfectly aimed visual gags but it never does much with its own satirical stylings.
Chloe Grace Moretz and the character of Hit Girl are so infinitely more entertaining than the film around them, you can't help but wonder why it's not just a movie about her.
A more tonally consistent piece than its predecessor.
The problem with being shocking is that you can only shock once.
Kick-Ass 2 has a twisted energy, and from the first scene, in which a caustic Mindy teaches Dave about the importance of a bulletproof vest, it tries everything it can think of.
Mindless drivel.
Although the film has the cheap veneer of female empowerment that comes from having a girl assassin, it is rotten with misogyny.
The tone's too rough to be funny. Kick-Ass 2 suffers from being a little too real.
It's well-acted, amusing and occasionally a lot of fun, but that's tempered with a mean, ugly streak that makes it quite sad to watch.
Should Kick-Ass 2 represent the end of the line for this polarising, guilty pleasure-defining franchise, it sure was fun while it lasted.
A rather dispiriting affair.
This sequel is really a pale shadow of the original.
Quite a fun ride.
A violent, often lewd, R-rated action film aimed at children and childlike adults, the film is part of a new trend: making sequels because some think that having a number in your film's title is a marketing advantage.
If you're a big fan of the first movie, prepare to be disappointed here.
Taylor-Johnson and Moretz were outstanding as relative newcomers, but that magic has also thinned. They coast on talent, but both were better in the first film.
When the movie isn't delivering thrill of the moment pleasures, we find ourselves with less than nothing: zero to hold onto and plenty to despise.
Kick-Ass 2 fails on every level imaginable, as well as a few levels heretofore unimaginable.
Like all the other shocking things that happen in Kick-Ass 2 -- including a couple significant deaths -- it happens, it's forgotten about and it's on to the next shocking twist.
Your enjoyment will depend a lot on whether you regard murder, mutilation and dismemberment as good, harmless fun. If you do, you will certainly find this movie a great deal more entertaining and wholesome than I did.
If 2010's Kick-Ass was a one-two sucker punch of glorious goofiness, the follow-up is a more thoughtful superhero send-up.
I don't think Wadlow's telling us to emulate anyone in the films. He's just showing you what sort of moral free-for-all lies just beneath the surface.
A total failure of a movie? Hardly. But in its will to reinvent and experiment anew with everything we discovered in the original, we'd have to call Kick-Ass 2 effectively powerless.
Kick-Ass 2 delivers a lot of laughs, the performances are still good, and it's certainly ambitious. But it's also decidedly hit and miss.
It's nasty and hard-R violent, which counts for something, somewhere. Just not enough for here or now.
Amidst all that activity, the "real-world" premise of the first film slowly disappears from view to be replaced by a fog of the familiar: teen angst, violent excess and yadda-yadda-yadda.
Arguably, too much time is also spent reiterating the cheesy mantra of there being "a hero in all of us", but the violent set pieces and edgy humour remain the same. Plus Jim Carrey as another would-be vigilante gives the pot a pleasing stir.
That's the advantage of being the scrappy, scurrilous underdog of the superhero world: you can dare to have your cake and eat it.
This time the transgressive punch-ups feel awfully forced.
It's a clever film but it's also a cynical and disorienting one.
Oh dear. Where to begin? How about everywhere?
Prediction: more tweets, Snapchats and texts will be sent during this film than during the original.
This inferior sequel finds the Hollywood journeyman Jeff Wadlow replacing the original director Matthew Vaughn, ditching much of the first film's ironic -humour and unhinged charm.
Subversive, naughty and often outright clever, Kick-Ass 2 is a satirical, and often on-target, look at comic book mentality.
Kick-Ass 2 has nothing to say, and it says it in the most vulgar way possible.
[Kick-Ass 2] wisely banks on the charisma of Moretz and Taylor-Johnson. But the filmmakers run out of script long before the climax.
Its witty humor and repartee [has] mostly [been] taken away, leaving only crass, unfunny lines that at the most inspire a chuckle.
The problem isn't that Kick-Ass 2 is tasteless and immoral. The problem is that it isn't funny.
Tonally disastrous, the movie attempts to depict gruesome violence as serious one moment and hysterically entertaining the next.
All the wonder and surprise of the first movie is gone. It's just aping the violence in other movies and other comic books.
The new ensemble is underused, but the central duo of Kick-Ass and Hit Girl are still likable, even if Hit Girl runs away with the film.
A disappointingly half-baked sequel...
Uma ode ao vigilantismo, deixando de estabelecer, no processo, a diferença que fazia o original tão eficiente: o fato de que, na fantasia, os atos de violência não trazem consequências reais.
Maybe we should have left this franchise where it started.
Yet the film's biggest treat - and this will come as no surprise to Kick-Ass fans - is how strong and magnetic a character Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) has become. She's great. Trouble is, there's not enough of her.
Funny, raunchy and action-packed. 'Kick-Ass 2' doesn't quite live up the creativity of its superlative predecessor. This is R-rated material that is not suitable for children or for those accustomed to PG-13-rated superhero fare.
Sometimes funny and extremely violent, "Kick Ass 2" is a by the book sequel that continues the concept of regular citizens becoming heroes.
KICK-ASS 2 defames the original. It's a style-less and humourless retread; sans heart.
The first movie was complete and did not require or deserve a sequel which this new movie proves
Unsure what it wants to say, Kick-Ass 2 is a forgettable action flick with just an occasional splattering of humour.
Offers a convenient punching bag for critics who want to equate the youth violence in movies with its manifestations offscreen, even if teenagers probably represent the ideal audience to both enjoy and see through this contradictory, nuance-free cartoon.
It definitely finds a few interesting places to go.
If the whole of Kick-Ass 2 had been 'Hit Girl Goes to High School', it would have been great.
A cancerous pretender promising something different but only offering up crass costumed zeroes
Extreme violence and outrageous comedy form an uneasy alliance in this outwardly enthusiastic but inwardly ugly comic book sequel.
Controversy aside, you don't get Millar-level recognition without some decent storytelling. Kick-Ass 2 has that, especially in Hit-Girl.
Keeps the manic mix of R-rated comedy and action seen in Matthew Vaughn's original while omitting the terrible attempts at shock-drama that polluted Mark Millar's comic.
These filmmakers have ended up with a sequel that lacks the freshness of the original film. It brings nothing new to the table, satisfied with simply throwing these characters together again and hoping that everything will turn out for the best.
Like many sequels, 'Kick-Ass 2' falls short of the original. It fails to achieve that delicate balance, achieved so well in the original film, of comedy and violence.
Easily one of the year's worst films.
It rocks more than enough polished and highly engaging sequences to entice you to overlook it's minor identity crisis.
In the end, Kick-Ass 2 just kicks the audience's arse too much, and with too much unnecessary force...
So long as Chloë Grace Moretz's murderous Mindy Macready - aka Hit Girl - remains in the limelight, I'll take little umbrage with the bastardisation of the comics upon which these movies are based.
Loses all of its edge while anxiously trying to convince the audience it's still a subversive bit of meta-superhero cinema.
Isn't it time Hit-Girl got a movie of her own? She's still the best thing about this franchise.
A movie that resembles Bugsy Malone with real weapons.
If Kick-Ass 2 manages to distinguish itself at all, it's by establishing a new standard for the level of disinterest a film can show in its title character.
Silly, ridiculous, violent and worthy.
A relentlessly-gruesome bloodfest of no redeeming value that at least Jim Carrey had the decency to 'fess up about.
An otherwise standard action film with B-movie feel, Kick-Ass 2 is a 'good' but not 'great' followup to the surprisingly smart, stylish and witty original.
This film will find its audience, no doubt, but here's hoping the stunts on display find no copycats.
Flimsy and floundering, one of the stupidest sequels ever.
Kick-Ass 2 by name - and Kick-Ass too by nature.
Solve a crossword puzzle. Call grandma. Do whatever you like. But don't see this reprehensible movie.
If it works at all, fitfully, it's because of the precociously talented and in-control Moretz, who basically carries the entire film on her own small shoulders.
Like its predecessor, "Kick-Ass 2" subjects its audience to some over-the-top, bloody and gross violence. ... But it is performed in such a pleasing, comic-book manner that you can't be repulsed nor offended.
It's as if the filmmakers wanted to deliver a bitingly sardonic satire of violence in society, but the studio was forcing them to make a mainstream superhero movie.
You're left with a legacy libel against Vaughn and Goldman that Johnnie Cochran couldn't defend.
Three years ago, Matthew Vaughn's crazy, wild "Kick-Ass" was shocking. It's a quality that is not duplicated in the new "Kick-Ass 2," which feels arbitrary and unnecessary.
Rote and bland. A "safe" follow-up to a movie that rejected the very notion of safety.
It's rambunctiously amusing but the laughs clot in your throat. There's a meaner streak this time to Kick-Ass and Hit Girl's exploits, or maybe Carrey's sensitivity is justified. Either way, the third act of Kick-Ass 2 is a visceral beatdown.
Sequel offers exactly the blend of R-rated nastiness and candy-colored action fans expect.
Even the novelty of a deadly, blasphemous Hit-Girl wears off, and all that's left is over-the-top violence and under-the-belt humor.
It's a bumpy ride to the final heroes vs. villains melee, and the film is frequently stopped dead by meaty chunks of exposition and Kick-Ass' disquisitions about what it means to be a hero.
Even more than its predecessor, [the movie] can't bridge the inconsistencies between its depiction of cartoonish ultra-violence and its characters talking about the deadly consequences of such violence.
The sequel just brings back the survivors and has them look around with palms raised going 'now what?'
Saying Kick-Ass 2 stands in the shadow of its predecessor is an understatement. Its monotonous writing restrains the sequel from enhancing the story the way that it should. Kick-Ass 2 lacks maturity and no amount of Union J can fix that.
Kick-Ass 2 is the very model of a sequel with no place to go.
Imagine if Jonathan Swift had penned a sequel to A Modest Proposal where you couldn't tell if he was serious about cannibalism. That's Kick-Ass 2, a weird, fake satire. LET THEM EAT BABIES. I THINK.
Kick-Ass did. Kick-Ass 2 doesn't.
Tossing aside just about everything that made the first movie a cult favorite, Wadlow makes clear he doesn't understand the meaning of the word parody.
'Kick-Ass 2' is unsurprisingly more of the same and I enjoyed it nearly as much as I did the first film, although it does trend a little darker this time around at the hands of writer and director Jeff Wadlow.
"Kick-Ass 2″ is a solid film that will surpass your expectations.
The movie is undeniably clunky and self-consciously extreme. But it's also very entertaining for those open to the experience. (Full Parental Review also available)
An exercise in trash-talking teenage ultra-violence that pushes many of the same buttons as its predecessor.
The first Kick-Ass wasn't a great movie, but it did have two great jokes driving it. With Kick-Ass 2, the joke is entirely on the audience.
Kick-Ass 2 is goofy, foul-mouthed at times, very violent, and both Kick-Ass and Hit Girl get to, well, kick ass. It is what the film promises, and it delivers.
Bravo Jim Carrey, bravo. Refusing to promote your work in Kick-Ass 2 is the wisest career move you've ever made.
Just as confused, conflicted and poorly conceived as the hero himself.
"But did we make the world a better place?" they keep asking each other. Kick-Ass 2 sure doesn't.
This time around the lessons learned from the first film seem to be largely forgotten and the script strains to find credible motivators to get Kick-Ass and Hit Girl back into their latex.
Even fans of the original are likely to feel deeply disappointed.
What was once shocking now just elicits a shrug.
The year's most unpleasant movie.
The savvy wit and inspiration on display in the first film is absent in this dumbed-down, warmed over retread. Consider its ass kicked.
As far as I'm concerned, it's "check please" for this franchise.
Even more so than its predecessor, Kick-Ass 2 presents a nihilistic view of the 'real world.'
New writer-director Wadlow (Never Back Down) makes one severe misstep with this sequel to Matthew Vaughn's snappy 2010 Kick-Ass: he loses the irony.
Compared to this lame attempt at storytelling the first Kick-Ass is a masterpiece.
Kick-Ass 2 feels fatally miscalculated, a would-be genre deconstruction that explains way too much without understanding at all what it wants to say.
Feels like the limp, uninspired third installment of a franchise that should have been put out of its misery a film ago. Skip the further adventures of Kick-Ass and his Super Foul-Mouthed Friends.
Although it lacks the provocative originality of its predecessor, [the film] maintains the same sense of fun and over-the-top absurdity that made the first Kick-Ass such a blast.
Kick-Ass 2 is a complete and utter nasty disappointment
Kick-Ass 2 is passable, but is completely missing the spark that made the original work.
Wadlow's biggest mistake is in overlooking the obvious - this movie belongs to Hit Girl. Every time she is off the screen, it's like the projector bulb fades.
"Kick-Ass 2" can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up: a vessel for unhinged vengeance and destruction or a meta-critique of those same impulses.
Previously, audiences thought the adventures of these high school heroes was fun, subversive stuff. After seeing this take on their escapades, things won't be so amusing, just aggravating.
Writer-director Jeff Wadlow establishes a premise and follows it without compromise, but the trail leads to a very ugly place. In the end, the journey wasn't really worth it.
It revels in carnage while lacking the visual style and gleeful humor of the original.
It apparently endorses vigilantism, and its attitude toward violence seems to be that it's mostly hilarious but sometimes it's supposed to make us feel sad about what an awful waste it is.
I miss Nicolas Cage.
There isn't anything good to say about "Kick-Ass 2," the even more witless, mirthless follow-up to "Kick-Ass."
Cartoonishly violent, with blood spray, vomit spew, severed limbs, impaled torsos and more, Kick-Ass 2 has none of the punky flair of the Matthew Vaughn-directed original.
It's a smart, edgy, unpredictable action-comedy, the tonal opposite of overwrought sculptures like "Man of Steel."
It no longer seems very smart (the YouTube and texting references are so 2010) and it's also not much fun anymore.
morally repugnant.
The meta-satire hits you over the head until not just your Spidey sense is tingling.
It's funny, action-packed and self-effacing at the right moments: "Kick-Ass 2" just may have taken a boot to every other hero hoping to be the top dog on the big screen this year.
...an even more pronounced cartoon that maintains the first film's habit of mocking comic conventions while rarely subverting them.
"Kick-Ass 2" has a mean-spirited vigilante streak the first film lacked (it seemed more concerned with justice, in its way), as well as a fatigue.
A disappointing and largely pointless sequel that fails to capture the tone of the original and ends up feeling unpleasant on a number of different levels.
We wish this left a sour taste in the mouth, instead it leaves nothing.
What seemed edgy and brash in the original film is now routine and old-hat.
A joke isn't as funny the second time around, and maybe especially not if you shout it.
Bungles the original cult hit's stylized ultraviolence and blunts its wincingly sharp humor.
Kick-Ass 2 contains almost all the same themes and ideas as the original, but it wears them on its sleeve and in its openness loses the very themes it is so obviously trying to express.
Give this to Kick-Ass 2: it's never boring...Even so, Kick-Ass has lost most of its transgressive charge along with its element of surprise and its heroes' disturbingly unwavering conviction.
So yes, Kick-Ass 2 does have its share of winkingly subversive humor. It also takes care to honor the emotional connections that the first Kick-Ass established for anyone who was paying attention
"Kick-Ass 2" literally stabs good taste in the eye, featuring dismemberments aplenty and so many raunchy one-liners Hit-Girl's alter-ego might actually be Joan Rivers.
Questions of Identity Drive Surprising "Kick-Ass 2."
Despite its genre-busting origin, this is simply good guys vs. bad guys material. And credit to "Kick-Ass 2," you desperately root for the good guys to win.
A repellant, mostly unfunny, distasteful-and-not-in-a-good-way mess of mixed messages and tonal confusion.
To stand out in a crowded marketplace, a sequel can't just kick ass - it has to blow minds.
While there are some solid gold moments, the story as a whole has an unfocused, meandering quality, and there are elements that simply don't work.
Literal and figurative crap.
Who could ever anticipate a movie with absolutely nothing going on in it but bad taste?
One could argue that Kick-Ass was all style and no substance. Kick-Ass 2 has absolutely none of either.
Sticking to the original's box-office-busting formula of blood, guts, boobs, and bad words, Wadlow sleepwalks through the material, failing to inject any personality into what's actually an incredibly disturbing story of pathological teens.
The overall effect is sporadically funny but also wildly uneven and ultimately something of a letdown from the first Kick-Ass.
If you still love the characters, there's enough to like here that you won't be mad. Unless you think too long about their wasted potential.
Just about as good as the first film, meaning- if you'll forgive the cliché- it kicks ass!
Moretz is a dynamic presence, and fires off her spiky one-liners with magnificent timing. The downside of her star quality is that she puts the rest in a pretty feeble light.
It's numbing and tedious, making Kick-Ass 2 less of a sequel and more of a coffin for the burgeoning franchise.
While it doesn't reach the dizzy heights of its predecessor, Kick-Ass 2 is nevertheless a hugely entertaining comic boom movie that's nastier and funnier than your average superhero flick.
A messy, confused, over-the-top mixture of brutality and sick comedy, puckishness and ugliness, self-awareness and tone-deafness.
Kick-Ass 2 is fun, but it isn't always funny.
Honestly, this movie is rank.
While Kick-Ass 2 does a decent job of replicating the look and feel of the original (as well as that of the Millar comics), it doesn't have the same urgency.
If there is to be another episode, it must surely be a Wolverine-style solo outing for Chloë Moretz's Hit-Girl. She is the real star.
"Kick-Ass 2" is a lesser version of what it appears to be, an uncertain jumble rather than a true exploration of outrage, violence and identity.
Its predecessor was almost shamefully giddy fun. By contrast Wadlow's picture is simply shameful...nasty, brutish, but certainly not short.
"Kick-Ass 2," while it retains a tone that varies wildly - though new writer-director Jeff Wadlow doesn't marry the two sides as effectively as his predecessor - lacks that fresh energy ...
A witless, mean-spirited sequel, "Kick-Ass 2" has the emotional maturity of an arrested 12-year-old and the ethical compass of a turnip.
A juvenile comedy of excess, in which skewering adolescent power fantasies looks an awful lot like indulging in them.
Crass and affected, preferring to snicker instead of recognize that kids wielding guns is a troubling thing and amateurs hunting down bad guys has moral and physical consequences.
This superior sequel cranks the bloody beatings, gorings, andmost importantheart up to eleven while building upon a sort of mythology ambitiously operatic enough to hang with the big-boy crime fighters.
Kick-Ass 2 is limper than the first movie, although it retains some of the humor.
The whole movie could be considered a questionable attempt at appealing to 14-year-old boys, as the delightful irony of the first "Kick-Ass" was apparently exhausted before the sequel was made.
Kick-Ass 2 is not without its occasional pleasures, but viewed as either its own movie or a follow up to its predecessor, the sequel is a pretty severe disappointment, and a rough cinematic experience to boot.
Doesn't knock you off your feet like the first instalment but has enough fast-paced freakishness to merit your time.
So faithful to the comics that whether you like the movie or not may already be determined by whether or not they're to your taste.
Kick-Ass 2 doesn't quite have the heart of the original. Just a lot of blood, guts and (very) rude words.
"Kick-Ass 2″ improves on its 2010 predecessor in at least one respect: It doesn't make the mistake of trying to pass off its bone-crunching brutality as something shocking or subversive.
If the original felt like it was designed for adolescents, however, this follow-up feels like it was made by an adolescent, one with a whopping case of ADHD.
Coming at the end of a comic book-saturated summer, it would be too much of a good thing, even if it was a good thing.
The film doubles down on the love-hate relationship with ultra-violence that typified its predecessor, but A History of Violence this is not.
You might not mind that director Jeff Wadlow, even more than Vaughn, has made sure that it's only the images that are provocative--never the ideas.
Exploitation-indoctrination cinema doesn't come any more crass than this unnecessary follow-up to the first "Kick-Ass" (2010) movie.
A slightly weaker dose of "more of the same", Kick-Ass 2 fails to match its predecessor for sheer mad originality, but just about sustains the requisite level of action mixed with laughs.
The unloaded gun is also unfortunately a rather apt metaphor for the movie itself. Kick-Ass 2 may look powerful, but doesn't have much real pop.
The word that came to mind as I walked out of Kick-Ass 2 was "vomitous." The best thing that can be said about it is that it's not in 3D. That's not nearly enough
'Kick-Ass 2′ is founded on "why not?"
Where original director Matthew Vaughn and writer Jane Goldman somehow managed to tread a delicate tightrope between indulging fanboy fantasies and sending them up, sequel writer-director Jeff Wadlow falls off the rope.
Like a Comic-Con cosplay event gone horribly wrong, this poor excuse for an action comedy has nothing to say beyond a few expletives and nothing to offer but a shocking lack of appreciation for its own awful irony.
The tone of of Jeff Wadlow's sequel flails about like a bar room drunk in a brawl - despite hitting out in all directions, very few of its punches strike their target.
Your ass is constantly braced in readiness and hope, but it remains un-kicked.
Undeniably entertaining, but disappointingly half-assed.
A more modest success than the first Kick-Ass, but still of-a-piece with its scurrilous predecessor. Nobody flies a jet-pack up a skyscraper this time, but Kick-Ass 2 still has its share of over-the-top action, and the sweary laughs are just about intact.
A fun if sporadically schizoid return to one of the brighter, brasher comic-bookers of recent years. Now, about that Hit Girl spin-off...
Ultimately feels rather scattershot and disjointed, perhaps quite simply because it lacks the sheer left-field originality of the original...
Though riddled with issues - and not quite as ingenious as the first - it makes for incredibly fun viewing.
You'll still be laughing, but where 'Kick-Ass' giggled at action cliches, this sometimes slips into them.
Focusing on a movie's strengths can be tough for any sequel that fails to live up to the expectation and hype. Kick-Ass 2's idolisation of its predecessor merely compounds this problem.

@highlight

Kick-Ass 2 falls short in its attempt to emulate the original's unique blend of ultra-violence and ironic humor.
