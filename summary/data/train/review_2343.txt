...the film boasts a promising opening half hour that's slowly but surely squandered...
For two thirds of the film, Hide plays as David Lynch and Quentin Tarantino-lite and not those filmmakers as they are today but as they were in, say, 1994.
It's a good deal too stagey to work as a thriller, but the location shooting on desolate mud-flats is resonant and the twist has a sick verve. Addictive stuff.
Moody, minimalist and well-observed this is a quirky low-budget triumph for director Marek Losey.
It's all given a much-needed shot of credibility by the strength of the writing and the subtlety of the directing. Losey is a talent to watch, and 'The Hide' makes for one hell of a Hollywood calling card.
Every time you think you've got The Hide pegged, and marked it down as one of those small British films, it twists out of reach. A play adaptation that exceeds boundaries and defies expectations.
Marek Losey's thriller The Hide is a macabre gem. It's a crude but enthralling duel with shades of Peter Schaffer's Sleuth. Shades too of Hitchcock's Rope.
A claustrophobic, tense, ultra-low-budget British film with a neat final twist.
A beguiling thriller which draws its considerably grisly strength from a first class script.
The Hide is a modestly scaled but cleverly written chamber piece.
An enjoyably dark, sharply written drama with strong performances from its two leads.
One claustrophobic location, two men, a relationship that shifts with the flood tide... and a film that far exceeds the limitations imposed by its low budget and small scale.

Cleverly written and directed, this is a tight, atmospheric and claustrophobic low budget British thriller.
