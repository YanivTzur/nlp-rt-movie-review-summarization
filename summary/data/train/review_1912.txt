Even before it begins laying waste to the reputations of cast members, "Firestarter" is promptly exposed as a derivative embarrassment of a conception.
Firestarter wasn't great, but everyone involved survived... as you will if you ever feel the need to give it another look.
While no means a masterpiece, it's a Stephen King film worthy of viewing once or twice...
A scene-stealing performance by a menacing George C. Scott and a terrific musical score by Tangerine Dream elevate this entertaining companion piece to 1978's The Fury.
corny and overblown
Stephen King didn't like it, but it really ain't that bad.
More interested in special effects than in dramatic flare.
It's not great. It mainstreams all the novel's subversiveness, but it's watchable.
Bad movie. Bad career move. Bad in all respects.
One of the better King book-to-film adaptations.
"back off" indeed
Weak horror flick with sick overtones of pedophilia.
A whole lot of explosions punctuate a whole lot of blather ... and it's one of the most woefully miscast adaptations I've ever seen!












@highlight

Firestarter 's concept hews too closely to other known Stephen King adaptations, though it's got nice special effects (including scenery-chewing George C. Scott).
