A lazy, cynical film made for one reason only: to part you from your hard-earned cash. That all said, it holds one's attention surprisingly well.
A sequel to a surprise but modest hit has no right to be this lackluster.
More of the same, but what's in its favor, is Neeson's never-failing man's man toughness, which goes a long way in making for an entertaining film.
The follow-up has less action, less energy, less Liam Neeson awesomeness - in other words less of everything that people liked about the first one.
I surrender! I simply cannot absorb another fist, bullet or knife thrust into my atrophying brain by a hyperventilating Liam Neeson in the name of his stupid, twitty movie daughter, Kim.
"Taken 2" is really, really goofy -- it's even goofier because it thinks it's about the futility of vengeance -- but Liam Neeson almost makes you buy it.
Taken 2 is content to play out as a familiar and lesser version of its predecessor.
Good action. Neeson rocks as the death-dealing American ex-spy. What else do you need? Maybe "Taken 3â€³ isn't such a bad idea.
Taken 2 is a pointless sequel that tries to capitalize on everything that worked in the first film, without actually including any of it.
This is a halfway decent action film, but I do hope if they make another sequel of this, they make a better one.
More is definitely less in this sequel.
Yeah, 'Taken 2' is pretty much the same movie that 'Taken' was. Like its predecessor, it's preposterous and over-the-top. And, boy, is this actioner ever just plain fun.
If there were any justice in the world, this would be the movie inspiring mass riots. It's that bad.
On the evidence of this cheesy sequel, Neeson is in danger of becoming the new Steven Seagal.
Despite some pretty silly plot holes, this is a relatively entertaining hour and a half.
If you lie with dogs, you get fleas; if you go to Europe with Liam Neeson, you get kidnapped.
... less credible, less suspenseful and less satisfying than it was before.
Unfortunately -- and somewhat embarrassingly for the human race -- there appears to be a sizable market for movies as blitheringly idiotic as this.
Like American filmmakers, it seems the French don't know when to quit, either.
A sloppy, lazy, unintentionally laughable sequel.
There's an endless car chase that somehow manages to run 100 minutes in a 90-minute movie. Unless my math is way off, in which case it just felt that way.
Hard-luck bodyguard Liam Neeson is back in action, this time tracking down his abducted wife in Istanbul in an efficient sequel to the hit Taken.
Still delivers what the fans want to see: Liam Neeson being a total badass.
Neeson Caters to his Audience in Taken 2.
Megaton ... could use some more lessons in directing as he bombs in his strained efforts to recreate Pierre Morel's original.
If you're hoping for even a hint here of the original's appeal, allow me to quote the immortal words of Marko from Tropoja: 'Good luck.'
Liam Neeson's muscular dad is still in good shape but the sequel's flabby.
Compared to the balletic savagery of the first Taken, what we see here is far less intense, or creative.
I would have liked more insight into the characters but the heavy doses of action do entertain.
And why is it always the Albanians that cause trouble? In this film, Brian seems to have pissed off every Albanian on the planet except for Jim Belushi!
Taken 2 shows there's just enough juice in this formula to fuel a solid sequel. Any more Mills family kidnappings, though, and things will quickly descend into farce.
This sequel just comes off as rushed and very lazy in terms of plotting. If [the writers] had taken their time with it, they would have seen that the story is full of holes and that it was lacking the essential elements to engage the audience once more.
A passable yet underwhelming sequel...
Another perfect example that some sequels are a very bad idea.
There wasn't really anywhere for the story to go after 2008's surprise hit Taken, and this movie quickly proves that. Not only does it have that same appalling moral vacuum at the centre, but the plot becomes increasingly absurd as it progresses.
Jaws: The Revenge, with Albanians.
Fans of the previous film are likely to be left with a distinctly sour taste.
When Liam wants to kill the bad guys he just wraps his schvantz around their necks and strangles them to death.
Generic and mind-numbing, it leaves the door open for another, perhaps inevitable installment.
Shortcomings aside, this rattles along entertainingly and, at barely 90 minutes, doesn't outstay its welcome.
There is virtually no plot, just a succession of screeching chases and absurdly violent fights, some risible sleuthing and a great deal of talking on mobiles.
A meta-American movie, a Godardian spoof of the whole genre, an attempt to see how stupid and insulting a motion picture can be and still be a big hit.
Taken 2 is more of the same, except a little bigger, a little dumber, and a little less invigorating.
This latest installment in the Liam Neeson Punching Things franchise...it is talkier, feels longer, is shakier and just feels less satisfying.
As absurd as it is..., no one who is an action fan is likely to be disappointed. They may laugh at it, but they won't be yawning.
Taken 2 is a tedious rehash of the same bad writing, acting and editing of the original.
This is one sequel that should be Taken 2 the dumpster behind the theater, and tossed in with the rest of the rotting leftovers.
So lazily put together that it relies on flashbacks from its predecessor for the majority of its character development.
Neeson, despite having turned 60 in June, looks spritely enough in the role, and more than capable of another go-round should Taken 2 match its predecessor's success.
Watching sexagenarian action man Liam Neeson lurch through Taken 2 reminds us that there was at least one dude missing from the cast of The Expendables...suffers from chronic franchise fatigue.
As much as this picture is action driven, its greatest delights are grounded in personality, in the fun of having a protagonist who combines homespun values with velociraptor functionality.
exactly what I expected and wanted from the experience
Taken 2 is a dud.
There's nothing here that wasn't already accomplished better the first time around.
Utter nonsense, a film that plays like a cross between Seth MacFarlane spoofing the first film on Family Guy and MacGyver fan fiction (although nowhere NEAR as much fun as that might make it sound).
It's not good, but with the right sort of mindset, it can be cheerfully endured.
Neeson is once again the stalwart center of this giddy, entirely improbable and improbably enjoyable escapade.
Feels like more of the same, and not in a good way.
It appears that when Luc Besson wants to kill one of his promising franchises, he calls in Olivier Megaton to do the dirty work.
A good, solid, "B" level entertainment.
Why are the bad guys going after him at all? They know what he can do. Just avoid him; if you do go after him don't kidnap his family, you just kill them. Morons. Oh, and then Maggie Grace throws grenades off the roof.
It's unlikely that moviegoers will be quite as taken by the experience this time.
This felt like watching the US blow the Ryder Cup. Everything that could go wrong did, anytime there was a chance to make a play it failed, and the participants looked like they really didn't give a shit.
They left it open for another installment --- YIKES! The thought of "Taken 3" is too much to bear!
The only thing taken in this dreadful sequel is the audience.
There's a moment in Taken 2 when Neeson's profile resembles John Wayne.
'Taken 2' is ridiculous, but at least Liam Neeson knows it.
I'm pretty sure the French director is playing this movie entirely for laughs.
The ludicrous plot devices that allow Mills to go from point A to point Z insult the intelligence of the character and the audience.
It's fine, it works, it does what it sets out to do, but don't expect to be able to tell it apart from the first Taken.
The movie is atrocious, but Taken 2 is absurdly amazingly entertainingly horrific.
Films like this don't need a lot of logic to survive but credibility goes out the window a few minutes after it starts and never returns.
The emotional connection from the first film lingers long enough to keep this new one going for about an hour and a half.
In nature, lightning occasionally strikes the same place twice. In the movies, it almost never happens.
At least the bruised and battered Neeson takes our minds off the perfunctory screenplay.
A sequel every bit as clumsy, ham-handed, outlandish and laughable as the original was sleek, tough and efficient.
It understands what it's there to do: to make carnage suspenseful and revenge dramatic. And, in the most elemental way, it succeeds.
There doesn't seem to be a whole lot at stake in a movie where you can crash your way through the armed barricades at the American embassy with a stolen taxicab and survive without a scratch.
The one thing that comes across is Neeson's character really likes fighting Albanians.
"Taken 2" is nearly all nonsense, with villains so inept and slow-moving that there's little satisfaction in watching Mills take them out.
Just a mediocre action franchise with a solid actor at the head and a travelogue in its heart.
A hilariously bad, ostensibly serious movie.
The fight moves are so brief and contained that Angela Lansbury could manage them without risk of hernia.
After the setup, the movie's scenarios alternate between routine and ridiculous.
One series of dumb, overly convenient action scenes after another...it fails critically even in the action department, thanks to lots of confusingly fast zooms and rapid-fire cuts, making it virtually impossible to tell who's hitting or shooting at who.
If you love Taken for NOTHING but Neeson's action chops, chances are you'll be adamantly indifferent about Taken 2. For the rest of us, it's the sequel we all saw coming, unfortunately with the outcome we also expected.
doesn't just strain credulity, it snaps it smartly in two, ties it into a series of bow-knots, and then torches them while laughing with maniacal glee.
Pretty much the direct opposite of everything that was right about the first film. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)
After seeing Taken 2, you'll feel as if your time and money has been kidnapped, drugged and forced into the sex trade.
Basically a loose, lesser remake of its predecessor, there is the cloying sense that what is being watched is extraneous and unnecessaryÂ—and really, really loopy.
If it's an enjoyable action yarn you're after, best rent the first one.
Dumbing down doesn't come much dumber than this.
The first thing to be kidnapped is logic, as the action moves to Istanbul from Paris and Liam Neeson ridiculously reprises his role of avenging ex-CIA dad Bryan Mills.
More of the same from Liam Neeson, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
What was fresh and exciting in the original film is embalmed in a mechanical reproduction that insists against all logic the same thing happens in yet another foreign country.
Idiotic lines abound, such as commanding the daughter as she drives to, 'Go faster, go faster.' 'I can't, I can't!' she cries back. Perhaps the family is hoping to bore the killers to death with redundancy.
Ultimately, the audience for this film probably won't care about missed thematic opportunities or consistent character writing, but it's a disappointment.
The ludicrous plot and laughable dialogue are all in service of some very subpar action.
As they might say in the advertising department, it's an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride. But it could have been much more.
[Neeson's] acting makes him seem human and even vulnerable, someone we can't help but worry over even though it's those feckless Albanians we should be nervous about.
Seems like a nonstop car and foot chase, with Albanian after Albanian falling victim to Bryan's remarkable aim and hand-fighting skills.
Rigorously formulaic and far-fetched ...
It'll have a great opening weekend, but it still seems a shame to have diluted the action-flick purity of the first "Taken" with this cash grab.
Taken 2 grabs everything that was surprisingly enjoyable about the original film and batters it into the ground like... Liam Neeson beating up an Albanian human trafficking ring.
An empty, exhausting exercise, a pumped-up adrenaline rush that despite all the running around, goes nowhere.
Unnecessary, perfunctory, ramshackle: Taken 2 is all these things and less.
Taken 2 must not be taken 2 seriously, although at the very least Megaton could have found better ways to use all those glorious, antique-looking Istanbul backdrops.
A bit tamer, just as ridiculous, but the premise is looking pretty tired.
Why an actor of Neeson's ability would play this character once, let alone twice, is a mystery for the ages.
If a viewer enjoyed the exotic locale and fast-paced action in the original film, here they get a different city and even more amped-up happenings, with a plot that intrigues enough to reel a viewer in.
It's the same movie, second verse, but unfortunately with far less suspense this time around.
Taken 2 is a rehash of the original. Fortunately, they're leftovers from a fine first course.
In the end, the door is left open for a Taken 3, although you do rather wish the Mills family would just throw away their passports.
It's a stupid movie by smart people who aren't smart enough to realize it's stupid.
Some of the basic pleasures of the original remain intact (nobody shoots up a small room of bearded Eastern European men like Neeson), but ultimately the film feels compromised.
Taken 2 ... has the requisite abductions, speeding cars and Americans in danger on foreign soil, but the only ones truly taken for a ride here are those of us in the audience.
"Taken 2" triples the budget of the original but not necessarily the entertainment.
It's fun enough on its own relatively low-budget merits, but it's really nothing to die -- or kill -- for.
The issue here is still the threat of a child being raped and murdered just sits uneasily in contrast to jokey situations about that daughter starting to date.
Best enjoyed by those with short memories and a longing for needless excess.
This one was done by the aptly named Olivier Megaton, and he's done well with his brief, which requires him to keep the action flowing seamlessly and preposterously while showing off as many tourist sites as possible.
Unfortunately, most of the action is overzealously edited, to the point of incomprehensibility, but Neeson's purposefulness and menacing voice provide the framework for a performance.
Neeson's soft-spoken Angry Dad routine has been flattened into burlesque, giving him little to do but alternate between bumbling dork and efficient killer.
I didn't believe it. It was just too utterly, utterly implausible.
This is a pretty clichÃ©d affair, although it's an effective sweaty palm experience.
Good fun, and very oriental.
The stop-start narrative fails to build momentum and tension and there are no stand-out action scenes, although Neeson is as commendably straight-faced and determined as ever.
Taken 2, taken to where? Taken to the cleaners? In the original movie, Bryan Mills had 96 hours to save his daughter, in the sequel it seems like they have spent 96 minutes on the script.
It's virtually the same movie as the first and once again, it's simultaneously ridiculously entertaining and just plain ridiculous.
This film, lazy and mismanaged as it is, just feels like the only thing that's going to get taken unjustly is your money.
It's essentially the same movie as the first one- only less so. Regurgitated and redundant. Lacks the contained excitement of the first. Neeson deserves better.
Breathless and exciting, it will go well with a bucket of popcorn.
Revenge is a dish best served riotously laughable.
There isn't a lot of new ground being broken in what ends up being a perfectly respectable action sequel and little more.
'Taken 2' the cleaners.
The year's funniest thriller.
Megaton's sequel will pass a spare 90 minutes just fine, but will leave you with absolutely no lasting impression beyond a sense that the title might as well have been Taken 2 The Bank.
"Taken 2" is so much lousier than need be, and its action sequences look as if they were put together by someone who doesn't know what he's doing.
An arcade game provides pretty much the same "entertainment" and it's a lot easier on the wallet. And kinder, maybe, to your memories of Liam Neeson.
"Taken 2" is nothing more than a naked cash grab.
Neeson's Jason Statham-ization continues apace, but it's looking less and less like a welcome development.
The cast is uniformly capable and dead serious, and if you're buying what Luc Besson is selling, he's not short-changing you.
Liam Neeson is back for more Albanian mayhem in a dire and bloodless re-hash.
Less a movie than it is a cinematic waterboarding.
Any breathing room from the hurtling narrative illogic only allows the audience opportunity to notice slips in Mills's father-knows-best infallibility.
Even the estimable Liam Neeson cannot elevate this derivative, exploitative sequel, which is all about car chases
I doubt bets will be taken on there being a "3".
This is a massively disappointing and ultimately pointless sequel that completely ignores the (albeit extremely violent) guilty pleasure appeal of the first film.
Yet another underwhelming, box-ticking sequel in which the action feels as perfunctory as the plot.
See Neeson kill -- kill, Neeson kill!
The aversion to violent detail makes it appear as though Mills is applying light chiropractic manipulation rather than giving someone an involuntary dirt nap.
A laughably slapdash concoction of steely Liam Neeson speeches, stolen cues from the Drive soundtrack, poorly cut fight scenes, and a healthy heaping of xenophobia.
The first one offered the novel sight of Oskar Schindler going Commando. Unfortunately, this half-hearted sequel is low on novelty and lower on fun.
If this is any indication, Taken 3 will be nothing but Liam Neeson running around whatever European city ponies up the biggest tax credits, growling and beating up random swarthy passersby... It would be only a tiny step below this.
The script often feels perfunctory as if written by a template
I worried about Olivier Megaton's direction of the action scenes, when frenetic editing, jumpy camera work and tight close ups that collide to suck out all the juice and sense of what is happening
Most definitely not the great sequel that we were all hoping for. Way too dumbed down to fit in with a rating certificate and very disappointing.
The story is weak, opting for the Die Hard 2 approach of having the same thing happen to the same guy twice.
A cynical, contemptuous film whose sole reason for existing appears to be to squeeze the pockets of anyone who enjoyed the first movie. Don't give it the satisfaction.
When Liam Neeson uses his set of skills to hunt you down, it turns out that what he'll do is nothing compared to the butchering you'll receive in the editing suite afterwards
This is an expensive and lazy rehash that either doesn't understand what made its predecessor popular, or doesn't care.
Christmas dinner won't be boring this year.
Taken was no masterpiece and was often thoroughly objectionable. But it still had a drive and a sense of urgency that's absent here ...
An abject failure as both a slick actioner and a familial drama, Taken 2 signs its series' own death warrant.
Moviegoers who liked Taken and want more of the same will get precisely that.

@highlight

Taken 2 is largely bereft of the kinetic thrills -- and surprises -- that made the original a hit.
