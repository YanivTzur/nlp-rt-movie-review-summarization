While nicely acted and never less than watchable, Daylight Robbery is ultimately disappointing thanks to unsympathetic characters, some dodgy direction and a stifling lack of tension.
This small-budget heist movie, though hardly very original, is at least made with complete professionalism.
Tonally it stumbles between laddish laughs and straight thrills, with the result that Leonti doesn't quite get away with it.
Tonally askew, comedically misjudged and drearily thuggish, this can be filed with any number of post-Lock, Stock caper comedies where psychopaths are portrayed as lovable geezers.
Imagine a sort of Dog's Dinner Afternoon.
Daylight Robbery has the away day, the-sun-shines-outside-of-Walford feel of an Enders special. All told, a bit of a Regi Blinker.
It makes Guy Ritchie look like Godard.
A promising idea is let down by weak storytelling in this well-played but lacklustre Brit crime thriller.
Daylight Robbery...the exact expression that you're likely to utter if you pay for a ticket to see this utter garbage.

This poorly executed brit crime caper wants to be a Guy Ritchie film, but ends up more like an extended Eastenders episode.
