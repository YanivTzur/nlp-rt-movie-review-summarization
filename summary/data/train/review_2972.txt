There are elements of Aloha that are actually quite good, but ultimately it's two mismatched movies smashed together and is too messy to succeed.
It's another pretty trifle -- albeit one with huge aspirations that go nowhere.
When a major plot point hinges on a chance encounter with some video shot by an irritatingly precocious 10-year-old, well, you know something's awry.
Half the time while watching Aloha, I had no clue what was going on. Not so much the plot -- although I was admittedly a bit muddled on that, too -- but why anyone acted the way they did.
It seems less that Crowe's gifts have escaped him than that they've become disproportionate with his excesses, and we're less forgiving of those trespasses.
Aloha is Hollywood's biggest Hawaiian wreck since Michael Bay sunk those ships in Pearl Harbour.
A curious twist on the body swap comedy, with its talented creator and stars ostensibly pulling a switcheroo with a group of exponentially less talented people.
It's hard to know what anybody involved in this misbegotten mash-up was thinking, other than 'Hey! The shooting location's in Hawaii!' (The state looks beautiful here, but that's a bit like saying Sharon Stone was attractive in Basic Instinct 2.)
A mess of a romantic dramedy full of colonialistic offensiveness, forced quirkiness, implausible emotion, and oblivious masculine self-centeredness.
Crowe seems to be searching for a story with something interesting to say as opposed to telling a story with something interesting to say.
The whole story is a tangled mess. Aloha sees itself as a quirky, funny, and sad, but loudly announces when it's trying to be those things.
In [Crowe's] new movie, Aloha, the best of his trademark idiosyncratic banter and character interactions occasionally bubble to the surface.
Crowe, a former journalist for Rolling Stone, does know music, and the soundtrack is good. The on location Hawaiian settings are also nice to look at. However, there is little else here worth recommending.
While there are nagging flaws here and much scope for silliness, it works mostly as [Cameron Crowe] so loves his cast and characters.
There's real romantic chemistry here. Cooper is that rare star that can balance a charmer's lightness and wit with vulnerability and sincerity.
Like the characters, we're left waiting for something mythical or spectacular to happen. Unfortunately for Crowe, we'll probably find it in another movie this summer.
It's jumbled, hard to follow, and ultimately feels like three pretty mediocre movies mashed in to one trifecta of incoherence...
An unmitigated disaster.
Aloha is a mostly bad, uneven film with hard-to-know characters and a baffling premise.
The plot is a mess.
I'm sure Cameron Crowe will bounce back and make some more great films... but most will acknowledge that Aloha is a failure.
The movie serves up a taste of genuinely fraught and realistic native Hawaiian concerns, only to smushily sandwich them between thick slices of white people's well-meaning-ness, hokeyness and lovelorn dilemmas. Lei-lei land becomes la-la land.
Cameron Crowe may have been aiming for something in Aloha, but somewhere along the way he forgot to make a film.
Cameron Crowe hits rock bottom with this dull and mostly incoherent romance...
Don't be fooled by the gorgeous Hawaiian setting, glossy sheen or star-studded cast ... Looks are deceiving. "Aloha" is a wreck and squanders every ounce of talent those A-listers possess. You'll be embarrassed for them.
Suddenly Adam Sandler's working vacations in Hawaii look a bit better. Island natives shouldn't be upset over being excluded from Crowe's movie; they should be mad because they're in it.
How can it be possible that the man who wrote Jerry Maguire & Almost Famous deliver a screenplay as incomprehensible as that found in Aloha?
If Crowe hadn't tried to do so much it might have been more enjoyable
'Aloha' is as bland as a movie can be - and that's a sad statement, considering it's written and directed by Cameron Crowe.
Aloha feels thin, tonally weird, false, and undernourishing.
Hawaiian hot mess of a movie with an often unwieldy script, quickly gets under the skin and thanks to its A-list cast is inexplicably and undeniably endearing.
Aloha actually sports a pretty good clutch of storylines, but it just takes too long for them to kick in.
A disposably smooth ride, but you'll need to forgive the misjudged cultural-political military plot (an order that may prove too tall for some).
Even if this were well made in a technical sense, it would still be a weird heap of patriotism, astronomy, and Hawaiian folklore, piled atop a pat and predictable love story.
The basic narrative problem here is that there's more backstory than story. Cooper's supposedly deeply flawed wheeler-dealer comes off more like a bland frat boy with a Coppertone tan.
A decent cast gamely goes along, but little rings true, and suddenly Jerry Maguire is looking like a very long time ago.
I actually enjoyed the sprawling messiness of it.
There's not a laugh to be had.
Mostly, it looks like an expensive Polynesian theme party to which the audience has not been invited.
It's the scenes without dialogue that are the most memorable in this warm, likeable film in which issues big and small grapple for attention.
Aloha is the kind of movie a name-brand director makes on their way to being a name-bland director; Crowe's the Tim Burton of twee romance, taking much of the shine off his past glories by recycling them into modern, middling mistakes.
...fatally unaware of its own incoherence - both in terms of narrative and character.
With a bench this deep, it's mathematically impossible for the film not to be entertaining - or, at least, weird in an extremely interesting way. As it happens, Aloha is both.
A half-baked romance full of dead-end subplots and startling leaps in character development, with a third-act turn into a nearly incomprehensible conspiracy storyline.
It's not bad so much as alien, like a romantic comedy made by someone who's researched human behavior but had very few brushes with it in person.
Aloha, in spite of its cast, will not be a career highlight for anyone involved.
In Aloha, Crowe's fabled generosity toward his characters and actors becomes special pleading.
Safe and sane hip dialogue, beautiful people and a cast to die for drive this rom-com one step ahead of the crowd.
"When I'm good, I'm very good, but when I'm bad, I'm better," Mae West famously purred. Aloha mishandles that decree: When it's good, it's very good, but when it's bad, it's better left unseen.
There is virtually no chemistry between the lead characters, something that dooms "Aloha" to be less than mediocre. Well, at least everyone got a paycheck.
Aloha is the new Gigli. It's got a great cast, comes from a respected filmmaker, and was clearly subjected to so much reediting that you can scarcely even tell what the point was supposed to be anymore.
Avoid Cameron Crowe's soggy, celluloid pu-pu platter. It's tepid and frustrating.
Sometimes quirky and original just plays like odd and incoherent.
Between the lush tropical scenery and the beautiful faces in the cast, there's plenty for the eyes, but not much for the brain.
...such washed out scenes of Hawaii it might as well have been filmed in Needles...If you can't make it with three gorgeous stars like Rachel McAdams and Emma Stone for the guys and Bradley Cooper for the gals, set in Hawaii, you've got big problems.
Aloha has elements of Cameron Crowe's best work, but poor storytelling results in a film that's more perplexing than charming.
Somewhere buried in Aloha is an intimate romance. ... The plot on which [it] hangs, though, comes from another genre.
I've lost count of how many times Alec Baldwin enters a movie just at the point it desperately needs a comic lift.
Inspiration has become Cameron Crowe's crack. His films are all-you-can-eat pixie-dust buffet from which all unnecessary excitement has been expunged.
Filmmaker Cameron Crowe can't catch a break with Aloha, a Hawaii-set romcom that is a handful of stories struggling for a unifying tone, but is nowhere near as toxic as its advance buzz.
At heart, it's just a romantic comedy, slightly above average in this stagnant genre.
It comes at us in choppy bursts of brilliance and dopiness. That is at once its great charm and its great curse.
If Cameron Crowe ever succeeds in making a Hawaiian Casablanca, I would love to see it, but this failed attempt feels like the bastard offspring of Casablanca, Inherent Vice, Goosebumps, and Baywatch Hawaii.
Life is a mess. Aloha is a moving film about a man who is trying to decide whether to clean his life up.
Aloha is a great-looking movie with just enough bright spots to get us past the cloudy moments.
None of this "works." But it usually worked on me.
Crowe is deft at keeping the various plots spinning, but there are too many of them, and they don't intersect pleasingly.
As the story progresses, predictability and sappiness increase, and everything adds up to a formulaic Hollywood romcom elevated by good actors and a few inspired scenes created by Crowe.
This is a romantic comedy that has more than hearts on its mind. In addition to teasing the uneasy and complicated partnership of the military and the private sector, Crowe takes on issues integral to Hawaii.
Teen-friendly romcom has potential but tries too hard.
With every film, Crowe's formula comes more increasingly unhinged from any recognizable reality. Now his movies seem to take place on Mars.
Cameron Crowe writes movies like he's calling us in eighth grade with his heart on fire.
"Aloha" feels like several films at once, crammed together and sped up, with results that are emotionally hollow and narratively confusing.
There are enough small moments here to illustrate what might have been...but some shaggy editing and too many false moves - particularly the ridiculous climax and tone deaf epilog - deep six the film.
What should have been an entertaining romantic comedy from Crowe turns out to be an overly disappointing one. Shame on him for squandering such talent!
A big-name cast doesn't necessarily translate into a good movie.
Cameron Crowe throws every love story trick possible at the screen and nothing sticks. Say aloha - as in goodbye - to Aloha.
Infuriatingly messy and opaque...so misshapen and tonally awkward that whatever [Crowe] intended has to be imagined rather than experienced.
As a love letter to Hawaii, ALOHA is a sweet - and scenic - yet not always satisfying sentiment.
At least this feels like a Cameron Crowe movie.
Cameron Crowe used to make wonderful movies.
Writer/director Cameron Crowe is trying so very very hard to make a Cameron Crowe movie. However, he forgot the Cameron Crowe magic.
For all the screwball patter, smart-aleck similes, and zingy one-liners that Crowe has handed his mismatched cast, a kerplunking emptiness runs through Aloha.
Someone has taken "Aloha" into the editing booth with a chainsaw, handed the chainsaw to Stevie Wonder, given him five shots of bourbon and said have at it.
a glorious, unkempt disaster of a film
It is with great sadness that I must report the passing of writer/director Cameron Crowe.
Where to begin with Aloha? Begin by not going to the movie.
But like its hero and its writer/director, it won me back with the crackle of its dialog and charm of its poetry.
Anchored by the knockout pairing of Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone, the filmand its characters, and the world they inhabitis difficult to say good-bye to because it's just so effortlessly endearing.
Equally hobbled by an amateurish script and vaguely defined characters, the movie's long list of mediocrities have an anonymous quality, as though the director has been completely reborn as a hack.
Even with its off-balance, overstuffed storytelling, the film maintains a charm and energy that never flags, with brisk pacing and generally engaging performances from its deep-bench cast.
Crowe introduces a serious topic without really examining it, and even the romance feels off, with a pair of lovers who seem mismatched. To complete the picture, Crowe tags on an ending that's convenient but not convincing.
What happened to Cameron Crowe?
It's hard to find a level on which Aloha works. It's a murky, muddled mess.
Oh my God does Cameron Crowe try. Which is why it hurts so very much when he fails so very hard. And he fails catastrophically with Aloha.
Aloha is a marshmallow of a film: soft on the inside, soft on the outside and wholly devoid of substance.
This is the kind of film that is easier to mock than to grapple with on its own terms. It's littered with flaws, but sometimes those movies can be the most interesting ones. The Aloha cult fan club is officially open. I'll take one ticket, please.
At a time when franchises run rampant, we need someone like Cameron Crowe to help restore a little balance. But this movie's bad buzz isn't just gossip: It's fair warning.
Crowe clearly is a romantic at heart and has created an intriguing film dealing with a man whose personal life is caught somewhere in the middle between his past and future.
The curious thing about the whitewashing accusations against Aloha is that it completely ignores the movie's most genuine theme: white guilt.
It's a pity: with a little more craft, this could have been a tropical noir with a heart.
Will probably have viewers and especially critics wanting to say hello to it, but having no problem saying good-bye. (Full Content Review - Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. - for Parents also available)
Amy Pascal was right in those leaked Sony emails when she bemoaned a story that made no damn sense.
The plot is a hash when it's not a drag, and the 100-odd-minute cut of the film arriving in theaters on Friday seems hacked from something longer and baggier.
Aloha is a word with many meanings. In the case of Cameron Crowe's latest film, it's definition can only be "whaaaa?".
"Aloha" is as generic as its title. The islands exist solely as an exotic backdrop for the pretty Hollywood haoles to play in. Business as usual, and I never thought I'd say that about a Cameron Crowe movie.
"Aloha" isn't horrible, but it does have a pitiable odor about it, like a dog that's sat too long on the beach.
There are quintessential bits of Crowe in a film that just cannot commit to the payload it wants to deliver.
Now, Cameron Crowe's name above the title feels less like an invitation, and more like a warning.
Sadly, San Andreas is not the only disaster movie hitting theaters this weekend.
The head-scratcher of a plot makes even the best performances hard to appreciate.
There are grand, romantic speeches that will endure forever from Crowe's earlier work - "Jerry Maguire," "Say Anything . . ." - but you can't build an entire movie on them. Nobody wants two hours of "You had me at hello."
Despite its big stars and some initially interesting ideas, "Aloha" is a muddled movie, sporting thin supporting characters and so many subplots that none of them are satisfyingly fleshed out.
Sometimes confusing and often self-indulgent, Aloha is also kind of fabulous to watch. That's mostly thanks to a great cast.
It happens. Really talented directors sometimes step into the batter's box, take a gigantic swing, and whiff.
[T]here are times when it feels as if writer/director Cameron Crowe simply started filming with the basic outline of a screenplay that had yet to be written.
Crowe displays a willingness to reach for ambitious ideas and big-hearted, emotionally naked moments that other name-brand filmmakers are too terrified to explore. Aloha is a big mess, but it's also at war with American cynicism, and wars get messy.
As tonally misjudged as Elizabethtown and twice as disappointing, Aloha at least gave its cast a sweet paid vacation to Hawaii.
A forced and often cloying romantic comedy-drama with a strong, Bradley Cooper-led cast and an enticing Hawaiian setting but a bewildering mishmash of plot threads and themes.
barely tolerable... cinematic navel gazing
Despite a bevy of A-listers, director Cameron Crowe's Aloha fails to tell a compelling story or generate laughs.
Both Cooper and Stone have been terrific in other films, but based on their strained, cornball efforts here, I would almost gladly never see them again.
From the dewy-eyed closeups pushing a romance that doesn't click to the insipid Hawaiian pop meant to tie this mess together -- but doesn't -- this makes you wonder if Cameron Crowe has lost it. Or was just full of it, all along.
"Aloha" is one of those films whose characters behave and speak so irrationally that they no longer make any human sense at all. Crowe may have had us at hello, but he's losing us with "Aloha."
Soggy romantic comedy set in Hawaii that looks like it's been in the sun too long.
Perhaps the energy Crowe could have expended on shaping believable characters went instead to the cultural context.
Despite Eric Gautier's dreamy scenery of Hawaii and an A-list cast that would give David O. Russell a hard-on, Cameron Crowe's Aloha lacks any emotional resonance.
The result is a movie that's well-meaning but nearly unwatchable. Stay home and watch a better Crowe movie instead, and ponder what went wrong.
Blessed with a stellar cast and idyllic locale, Crowe seems reluctant to waste anything, including his own half-baked themes.
These performers are just good enough to wrest a few memorable moments from the general chaos of an eccentric romantic comedy that isn't particularly romantic or funny.
Aloha is so desperate to create full backstoried lives for all of its supporting characters, it creates subplots that go nowhere and convolute a simple story.
I don't know what Aloha is about. I can tell you what happens in it, but that won't really help.
Aloha is the film that finally convinced me that Cameron Crowe has nothing interesting left to say. And that hurts.
The director's latest effort is a Cameron Crowe film through and through - a heartfelt, funny and honest, albeit a little messy, romantic comedy.
I've never seen a movie quite like Aloha. That's meant neither as praise nor as a backhanded compliment; it's offered more in the spirit of one hand clapping.
Aloha is a pale, predictable effort from Cameron Crowe, calling back to his previous feel-good flicks without covering new thematic ground.
Another fascinating mess from an earnest and occasionally excellent filmmaker who can't seem to recreate the enveloping magic and charm of his earlier films.
After a while, the film's sing-a-song-for-the-world vibe, so buoyantly optimistic at first, becomes grating and smug.
If Aloha's earthbound elements are uneven, its rocket-launch aspects are downright confounding.
May be the strangest studio hack-up ever. It's as though it was cut up on random.
Operates on cuteness overload, attempting to manufacture Crowe's trademark sentimentality only through cloying, artificial sweetener.
A delayed and dismal attempt to marry screwball comedy with socially aware drama.
Unbalanced, unwieldy, and at times nearly unintelligible, Aloha is unquestionably Cameron Crowe's worst film.
While not as wildly misguided as 'Elizabethtown,' Crowe's latest effort is arguably just as dissatisfying and it will certainly set the back the trust in his brand for quite some time.
It feels both overstuffed and undernourished, as if it had either been rushed to the screen or pared down from a much more ambitious film.
The deepest understanding we get of any of these characters is that none of them would say the things that Crowe makes come out of their mouths.
Aloha seems more like 'A big huh?'
In 'Aloha' you can't see the jungle for the foliage.
Maybe Cameron Crowe was attempting to evoke the confusing complexities of adult life, but if so, he did his job too well. Confusion washes over this film in waves.
Cameron Crowe's newest romantic comedy doesn't quite work, but it is entertaining enough thanks to clever dialogue and old-school movie star charisma.
For a movie of seemingly simplistic aims -- a rom-com with tropical flavor -- it's shockingly hard to follow.
Aloha, for all its spasms of charm, feels like a push-button romance, its heroes glibly spouting lines with the hope that the words come to mean something.
The first encounter among Cooper, McAdams and Stone is so awkward and unsettled that it becomes the movie's own albatross. There are some moments, most of them thanks to McAdams.
Aloha is such an inchoate mess, such a forced, insular, self-pleasing misfire, that plotting it out can be a challenge.
Aloha may be Cameron Crowe's worst movie, which is a shame because we know he can make great films.
It's a big soap opera set against blastoffs, none of which is convincing.
How delightful to see a film that begins and closes in outer space be so warmly stargazing.

@highlight

Meandering and insubstantial, Aloha finds writer-director Cameron Crowe at his most sentimental and least compelling.
