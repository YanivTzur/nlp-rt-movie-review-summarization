High Art is often compelling and uncannily accurate in its evocation of downtown demi-monde characters and druggy, entropic milieu-the art in this film is high in more ways than one.
Clarkson's Greta... is wickedly funny, while Mitchell's ing√©nue convincingly combines puppyish idealism and steely ambition. But it is Sheedy's Lucy, nonchalantly sexy, sharply intelligent, tough and vulnerable, who is the film's heart and soul.
Warmed-over Red Shoe Diaries episode wrapped in a blanket of pretension.
A highlight of the 1998 Sundance Festival: Cholodenko depicts with unwavering veracity the breakup of one longtime lesbian relationship just as another, unexpected one begins. The acting of the three women, Sheedy Mitchell, and Clarkson, is superb.
Solid, sexy drama with a dash of wit. Fine performances especially by Clarkson.
Who knew Ally Sheedy was so sexy?
A solid if diffident, strongly character-focused drama worth the time of those who appreciate shoegazing introspection for the High Art that it is.
Needed some naked Radha (don't we all?)
The film feels superficial, with all its glib characters provoking an air of chic fashion.
A pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines, High Art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists.
This affecting film is one of the year's more intriguing art-house entries, and doesn't deserve to be simply relegated to a niche audience.
As a once-acclaimed photographer who drifted out of the New York art scene into a private world of drugs and dead-end relationships, Sheedy is a genuine revelation; gone are the days when she coasted by on charm and her girl-next-door smile.
Marks the superior feature film debut of Cholodenko, as well as Sheedy's strongest, and best, role to date.

A surprisingly sultry performance from Ally Sheedy elevates High Art from pretentious melodrama to compelling -- if still a little pretentious -- romance.
