[Bela Lugosi] pretty much steals the movie in his last really juicy role.
The third instalment of Universal's classic series features Boris Karloff's last fling as the Monster and is a superior shocker all round.
While the film sorely misses the guiding hand of director Whale, it has enough of the old Universal atmosphere to be of interest.
Basil Rathbone plays the title role in this average horror flick about reviving the creature for a second time.
A surprisingly good effort to extend the narrative of the first two films in a manner both intelligent and likely.
Well mounted, nicely directed, and includes cast of capable artists.
Boasts some stunning set design by Russell Gausman, a good script, and a magnificent cast.
A strangely literary and leisurely monster movie, laced with amusing gothic doodles.
not as good as Young Frankenstein, or the first two, but still a good effort
The set, shot in a style reminiscent of the German Expressionist classics, is superb.
Its silliness is deliberate -- a very shrewd silliness, perpetrated by a good director in the best traditions of cinematic horror.
It's enjoyable, not really memorable, but certainly a cut above what would soon follow.
A little too long, but beautifully designed and Lugosi carries the show.
Great plot that could have been fleshed out more.
Despite all its flaws, there are enough grand moments to make this into a superior Frankenstein tale.
One of the very best of the series
The last great Universal Frankenstein feature, despite Rathbone's over-the-top performance. Karloff is splendid as the creature and Lugosi launches a new phase of his career as Igor.
It comes as no surprise that this creature feature isn't remembered as a horror classic.

Boris Karloff's final appearance as the Monster is a fitting farewell before the series descended into self-parody.
