Has some good footage but is more Disney-anthropomorphic than Attenborough-authentic.
Like the real-life natural-world Disney features of yesteryear, there's a huge amount of entertainment to be had, especially for kids, although the imposition of a story and the attribution of various emotions to the creatures can get slightly cloying.
A movie guaranteed to enchant all. Mind you, with a cast this cute, they couldn't really fail.
Despite the involvement of a producer from the BBC's Natural History Unit and the late Paul Newman on voiceover duty, 'The Meerkats' is just another run-of-the-mill wildlife foray.
Visually striking but not a nature documentary for people who like their wildlife presented with the emphasis on knowledge and information, rather than on story, cuteness and anthropomorphism.
The beauty and intimacy of the material they so painstakingly captured ultimately overrides the mawkish score and sentimental narration.
"Even the wind has dust in its eyes," remarks Newman, at an especially weepy bit. Others may have trouble keeping them open.
The narrative lags some way behind the beautiful nature photography and the comical majesty of the meerkat on guard, poking his head above a hidey-hole like a periscope over a parapet. These pictures don't really need any words.
A film that is entertaining, informative and filled with irresistibly cute critters.
An engaging, beautifully shot wildlife drama with undeniably cute subjects, but you can't help wishing the film had probed a bit deeper into meerkat society.
Contains plenty of high drama thanks to some judicious editing and cutting-edge camera work and it avoids sentimentalising nature too much by showing death on screen and weaving in a subtle environmental message.

A cheerful and cute - though never overly mawkish - nature-doc about... you guessed it... Meerkats.
