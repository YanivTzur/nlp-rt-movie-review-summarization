The result is a very unappetizing dish, served in the form of a valuable documentary. [Full review in Spanish]
As a film, it functions almost to snow you under with bits of little-examined, often unconnected ideas. The narrative is segmented into extremely short intervals, all helpfully introduced by inter-titles with cute plays on words.
This is the kind of muckraking we should see more often.
This solidly constructed documentary aims to do for food production what An Inconvenient Truth did for global warming.
One word of caution: Eat before you see it. After it's over, the idea of a swing through the drive-thru might not be so appetizing.
A doco which could make you sick!

the film can help more consumers realize that "cheaper" food is NOT necessarily a bargain

Trading on now-familiar gross-out tactics (images of corporate slaughterhouses and chicken sheds), the movie offers very little that food radicals don't already know.
Suffice it to say, after the film's disturbing glimpses inside the meat industry, along with its blunt indictment of fast food giants, you'll think twice before eating just about anything nonorganic.
Kenner's documentary is a grabber from the very first frame, and the fact my refrigerator's vegetable bin suddenly finds itself filled with organics when it never had been before isn't even close to a coincidence.
