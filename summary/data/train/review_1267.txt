Goblet of Fire is great, very watchable and re-watchable.
Where Newell really scores is in taking a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book and cranking up the fear factor.
For those like me who are outside but sympathetic to the faith, it looks like another handsomely made, good-natured and high-spirited family movie, which is dramatically stymied through being locked within school grounds.
For the first time, adults might actually enjoy a Harry Potter film as much as children.
Goblet is really just a glorified, 157-minute teaser trailer, an empty epic of proportions that truly stagger.
The adolescent subplot is treated sweetly by Newell. The awkward dances and dating faux pas at the school ball feel like additions from some other, less mythic series, and form a welcome respite from the intense magic-making of the rest of the film.
Much of the credit goes to Radcliffe and his co-stars, who have become better actors with each film. They have become increasingly adept at conveying great emotion as each film demands more of them.
I think this is the best Potter film yet, for one simple reason: it's not like a Harry Potter film.
In its last third, The Goblet of Fire builds to a climax of such overpowering dread that you might just forget the rest. Harry grows up in an instant, and the film does, too.
The acting is stronger than ever in this fourth installment.
By demonstrating to us how Harry and his friends are budding and changing and struggling, the film demonstrates the progressive richness of Rowling's storytelling skills and oddly haunting allure of her writing.
All in all, Goblet of Fire is certainly the best Potter yet, with most of the cast doing their roles justice, some great direction and Steven Kloves' screenplay makes the core of Rowling's novel into a fast-paced but easily-comprehensible enjoyable movie.
Kloves has streamlined J. K. Rowling's 700-plus-page opus into cinematic fighting form. And the special effects, which threatened to overwhelm the first two movies, are seamlessly integrated.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is mostly satisfying, simply because such technical precision and meaningful special effects are rare in fantasy films today.
This fourth segment of now-adolescent Harry Potter's story, while arguably the best made, is also the most gruesome, and dark.
With its grand special effects, many small moments of charm, and continuing development of the characters, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire takes us into a world that, evil or not, makes us reluctant to leave.
Newell vividly conjures up a world fraught with real danger.
As young wizard Harry Potter continues to mature, so too does this exciting fantasy franchise.
Goblet again serves up a delicious who's who of British acting, with hilarious contributions from newcomers Brendan Gleeson as instructor Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody and Miranda Richardson as nosy reporter Rita Skeeter.
Goblet of Fire is more effective in these smaller, more intimate moments than in the bloated bombast of its larger set pieces.
Very boring, recycled from the previous installments, and immensely underwhelming.
Wait a minute. Sequels aren't supposed to get better.
It's downright scary how good this movie is.
A huge cast, plenty of special effects and Harry gets a battering -- pretty much as you'd expect.
A marked disappointment after Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, this fourth installment in the franchise is a 157-minute holding pattern.
The Goblet of Fire is a more mature story and its young stars prove they have the acting skills to grow with their characters.
Easily the best Harry Potter film so far.
The story is engrossing, but Mike Newell's adaption is a little too dull and by-the-numbers following Alfonso Cuaron's visual tour-de-force.
Chapter four in the boy-wizard franchise, and still no good scenes, interesting characters, or true imagination
Followers of the series will find a more mature Harry and a more mature style, less sugary but not actually drier than the previous films.
Goblet has enough sense of real kids maturing and believably facing problems to cast some genuine spells.
A solid but mostly uninspired melding of the adventure and fright that have been the benchmarks of the franchise.
Like a fine wine, Harry Potter continues to improve with age as each succeeding film version of Rowling's books seemingly surpasses the last.
Finally we're seeing Harry (the character and the series) grow up.
The action in Goblet of Fire is more exciting and faster-paced than in previous Potter films, and visually, it is by far the most splendid.
This new story starts off as just another adventure, more or less, but by the end, the situation faced by its protagonists has become much darker, and much more dire.
Never feels anything other than a single thread of a larger narrative.

The grim tone feels overwrought but, in [Mike] Newell's hands, and in those of his cast and screenwriter's, the movie remains dramatically solid
Newell handles this unfamiliar material competently enough, but the film never picks up any true momentum.
It's refreshing that Potter 4 aspires to be a paranoid thriller rather than yet another detective mystery. House points, too, for the movie's terrific effects and considerable charm.
The series is now being treated as it should be, with the right mix of magic, danger, and drama, without watering anything down just so a younger audience can be snagged.
Anything but a disappointment. Even if it doesn't achieve the lyrical enchantment of Prisoner of Azkaban, it nonetheless makes good on Rowling's darker turn in the series.
For me, the best entry in the series--the sweetest, the most exciting, the most moving, and the most touching.
Goblet is deliciously dark, wickedly funny and superbly mounted.
In the book this is a wholly engrossing story -- an epic tale of good and evil and loss and yearning. Transported to the screen, however, it has sustained a few dinks and dents.
It's too episodic, relying on action rather than emotion. The pace is headlong, so that the characterisation suffers.
The film's quick pace and near-constant action carries you along quite nicely.
So bloated and joyless that it makes one pine for the bland mediocrity of Chris Columbus.
Even though Goblet of Fire clocks in at a robust 157 minutes, Newell handles the massive story with seeming ease, keeping the pace taut and intensifying the pervasive menace that lurked more subtly in the previous films.
With the Triwizard Tournament as the centerpiece, director Mike Newell fashions an action film for children that may be without any reasonable challengers.
Closer kin to numbers one and two in the series, in both massive running time and playing like more of a book-on-film than the artistic peak achieved by Alfonso Cuarón in the third installment.
Without ever losing sight of what makes a Potter film truly magical, [director Mike] Newell provides an aura of genuine dramatic gravity.
The most focused Potter movie yet... it's all about puberty and death.
Newell not only does Harry Potter right but eclipses the scope, scares and drama of his J.K. Rowling source novel.
It emphasizes the emotional development of its characters with dramatic interplay rather than expressionistic, atmospheric gloom.
Thankfully we have the increasingly interesting characters and their interactions to provide the bulk of the entertainment.
Newell has always been a capable showman, and he doesn't cheat the Potter audience. Yet I don't think he wows it, either.
Whenever it hits its stride, it's a well-acted, vividly executed, full-speed-ahead special-effects extravaganza that puts as much bang as possible into every remaining scene.
What does work, as in the last film, is how richly the filmmakers dive into Harry's growing and evolving adolescent personality.
An overlong film.
Works as a piece of blockbuster entertainment.
The film's real pleasure is in the connections it makes (whether intentional or not) to current 'real world' questions about the beneficence of institutional authority.
Newell proves -- well, wizardly in depicting Hogwarts' inner workings.
A focussed, efficient film that lacks charm but gets the job done.
Let the adjectives roll  this is the most thrilling, exciting, magical kids movie Ive seen since, well, since the last Harry Potter film.
It feels a little rushed, and although it is still a picture worth seeing, it stands as one of the weaker chapters in the Potter series.
Once again Grint, who has grown up to be a talented comic actor, is the scene stealer here. If I had a crystal ball, I'd say he's the actor whose post-Potter future seems most certain.
The human element is never overshadowed by the flashy stuff.
Enjoyable sequel that should please fans of both the books and the films %u2013 it looks as gorgeous as the last one did and this time they've even tightened up the plot a bit.
Goblet has some truly stunning moments, especially the pitch black finale.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is yet another solid entry into the Harry Potter franchise.
The first Potter film to improve on the book
A sombre and dark entry into the series, but one that is well-worth seeing.
Wondrous to behold.
Goblet of Fire is largely about the growing pains as the children inch towards adulthood, including love and all that comes with it, and Newell does a strong job of painting adolescent jealousy, crushes, and discomfort.
The exhilarating Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire takes the best parts of J.K. Rowling's fourth installment and serves them up in one heck of an action-packed, albeit darker, film. Parents, be forewarned--this isn't kid's stuff anymore.
An overstuffed plot doesn't slow down the proceedings as much as convey that there's much at stake in Harry's increasingly sinister world.
For someone who has read the book, the film is very satisfying; glosses over important information for the uninitiated.
Harry Potter ha crecido y para bien, lo que abre el apetito para la próxima cinta de la serie. Encantadora y mágica, es sin duda una de las más gratas sorpresas del año.
The best part, I think, is that this fourth Harry Potter film goes further than its predecessors in setting out a moral map that reaffirms the values of human decency, loyalty and selflessness - and does so with great flair and endless entertainment.
Tenso e envolvente, embora substitua a complexidade psicológica e emocional do filme anterior por uma montagem mais preocupada com a história do que com os personagens.
For once, Harry Potter is pushed to his limits. He doesn't just wave his flippin' wand and win the day.
Has the curious distinction of being perhaps the best of the Harry Potter series, while not being quite the best film in its own right.
My cup runneth over with tedium during this 2 1/2-hour supernatural slog.
The billion-dollar franchise continues its reliable mix of youthful wonder, charm, and sense of adventure, all while making it accessible to adults and children alike.
Hits all the right spots but there's crucial context missing at times that leaves a vastly different impression with those who have followed the films but not read the books.
Harry Potter fans will not be disappointed by the happenings at Hogwarts. Gone are the 'cute' little wizards and witches-to-be, but it's still magical.
Once again, the young wizard has audiences enchanted.
...nothing much can dim this material.
...another year has passed at Hogwarts and Ron Weasley is another year uglier.
The Harry Potter series just keeps getting better and more interesting.
Si dejamos de lado el tratar de forma recalcitrante de hacer una copia del libro, la película es una buena muestra de diversión y cine de fantasía.
Time drags between the feats of abdacadbra.
Kloves has successfully streamlined the 734-page novel into a concise adaptation which focuses on the driving dynamic of the story but still feels coherent.
The latest episode of JK's wonderful allegory of childhood maturity demands your muggle attention
It's sweet, it's charming, it's endlessly involving... the best yet of the Potter films.
As exhilarating as it is daunting, 'Goblet of Fire' is all grown up.
What will allow the remaining films to prosper, is the words that we hear at the start, from an elderly caretaker: "Bloody kids."
Stylistically, the most stylistically stunning film of the series ceases to be wondrous ... once its characters enter the painfully petty years of adolescence.
The special effects are first rate but I think it's always going to be about the characters. And they're great characters.
It's always a treat to see what big-studio-franchise cash can produce in the way of top-flight British (and Irish) actors.
La srie Harry Potter ne deviendrait-elle que l'quivalent magique des films de James Bond?
The ball is coming. It's a 'night of well-mannered frivolity,' as Maggie Smith puts it, 'much like the splendidly impetuous time I had with Harry Hamlin in Clash of the Titans.'
A film with such fiercely written source material, the best effects money can buy, and the support of J.K. Rowling, can't be bad.
Think of it as a sort of Sixteen Wands, and you won't be disappointed.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is more competent than inspired, but that's still not bad.
Masterful storytell[ing], ceaselessly and effortlessly tantalizing and satisfying
Of the several strange and thrilling sights in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a noseless Ralph Fiennes may be the strangest and most thrilling.
Overall, Goblet is a feistier, darker and more suspenseful extension of a cherished film franchise that oddly prospers with cinematic age.
One of the best in the impressive Potter series.
This is really cool!
While a must-see for rabid fans, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will impress nondevotees only with its seamless special effects and captivating action sequences.
... to finally watch the key scenes so vividly described by the author realized perfectly onscreen is worth admission alone (and even a few extra viewings besides).
[Mike] Newell turns the spine-tingling and well-crafted world J.K. Rowling created for the novel into a lump of flat banality.
It's nearly as epic in its scope and deep in its philosophy as the 'Lord of the Rings' films were -- the first film in this series to even approach such heights.
Wow! Harry and his pals are back and they are better than ever.
Maybe if I had read one of the books first, seeing it come alive on the big screen would be a more seductive and satisfying experience.
As a whole, [it] is the least impressive of the four Potter films.
This is the best "Harry Potter," yet, and should be the benchmark that all the rest, past and future, should be compared
You feel the durable franchise (now on its third director, Mike Newell) has a promising future, since its young principals have developed skills.
Inventive visuals and funny bits abound, but the film's gritty look and unsentimental characterizations -- Harry, Hermione and Ron are far from golden teens -- ominously foreshadow the truly wicked shape of things to come.
Screenwriter Kloves deserves a tip of the wizard's hat for cutting Rowling's immense tome (636 pages) down to size, and for keeping the story moving despite a surfeit of characters and incidents.
Not just an efficient babysitter but a wizard of a movie.
With Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, director Mike Newell offers a fine addition to the Harry Potter film franchise without presenting any truly spectacular elements.
Swiftly paced and wonderfully atmospheric, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will satisfy both the most ardent Potter-philes and newcomers to the Rowling franchise.
Visually exciting and dramatically flaccid, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire seems destined to separate the faithful from the phonies.
If there's a Harry Potter fan at your house, you're going to this movie regardless of what anybody says about it. Fortunately, what most people are saying about Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire is, 'wow!'
The real hero of the fourth Harry Potter film isn't the teenage wizard but screenwriter Steve Kloves, who has magically transformed J.K. Rowling's bloated, 734-page novel into a more swiftly paced, entertaining script.
The special effects blend impeccably with a robust, forward-driving sense of action.
Like Chris Columbus, Newell delivers what is essentially an illustrated condensation of Rowling's novel.
There is still some subtle and unexpected levity.
...likely will be enjoyed by those who read the 734-page book -- and were smart enough to bring it into the theater with them for quick reference.
Newell deftly mixes in sweet teenage angst and lighter moments of physical humor.
This edition advances the Potter saga through the presentation of a variety of set pieces, some quite spectacular. And if the movie sometimes loses momentum, it contains enough grand sights and magical mayhem to stir even skeptical imaginations.
It boasts some strong performances. Irish character actor Brendan Gleeson steals the show as the appropriately named Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody, and the three young leads show increasing confidence in front of the camera (especially Grint).
A brisk, darkly-tinged adventure yarn that boosts the action quota considerably and as such becomes a whirlwind blast of post-summer escapism.
With more melodrama, meatier magic and much malevolence, the latest film foray into J.K. Rowling's wizard world proves the fourth time can be a charm, too.
Frankly, the entire film felt like the cinematic version of Hamburger Helper -- too little meat trying to do too much.
Mike Newell does an exceptional job translating the fourth book to the screen, showing a remarkable flair for cutting-edge visuals.
Newell snags Cuarón's cinematic baton and sprints, maintaining the dark tone of Azkaban while sprinkling in healthy doses of humor and humanity.
The most frightening Potter film and the best.
An acceptable but far from challenging adaptation that almost any director could duplicate.
What was a sneaking suspicion after the first three movies has become irrefutable proof [here]: if you are not a fan of, and intimately familiar with, the Harry Potter novels, you're not welcome here
"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" will satisfy the older fans who have read the book:
Although the plot of this installment explores 'three unforgivable curses,' the sequel avoids the 'curse of the fourth film,' proving there is still a heap of charm left in this young wizard's tale.
A rare film that does it all and never loses itself along the way. Successfully blends drama, action, comedy, romance, and mystery to form an almost flawless movie.
The days of cheesy basilisks and house-elves are gone -- things have taken a sharp turn into Bleaksville.
Dark and daring; the novel takes a shockingly violent turn in its final pages, and the PG-13 rated film doesn't shy away.
"Goblet of Fire" is the first film in the series to mark a turning point in terms of quality of direction and storytelling.
Does a fine job consolidating all the important elements of J.K. Rowling's book. You get the same arc for every character and it doesn't take a month and a half to finish.
The latest entry... leaves out subplots and entire characters, yet gets it exactly right. It doesn't lose what's crucial to the story...
Cuaron's film still ranks as the best...but not by much.
Forget battling dragons or dealing with mer-people in the dangerous tournament, Goblet of Fire is as much about the angst of young love as it is about wizardry.
What sets this outing apart from the three that have come before it is its darker tone.
As we come to the midpoint of J.K. Rowling's tales, it may have finally turned the page for the better.
Goblet of Fire is easily the most confident of the series, with the production finally comfortable with the demands of the divided audience, and not afraid to please both.
Offers some of the series' most magical imagery… Alas, with so much territory to cover, some characters get short shrift.
Director Mike Newell has brought majesty and magic back
Although Valdemort is a bad guy, this is a good thing for movie audiences. He's set up to be the new Darth Vader of pop culture.
Newell expertly makes the smallest moment of adolescent longing as vivid and meaningful as the WOW-worthy special effects.
has succeeded in doing one big thing that the first three movies completely failed at: For the first time, I'm actually looking forward to the next in the series.
Although last year's installment, The Prisoner of Azkaban, was supposed to the be the darkest in the series I daresay Goblet of Fire is darker still.
Another solid chapter in an eminently reliable franchise.
There is a good movie here, but there is too much story for such little time.
Flawed and too long, but not bad
In his scheme of things, fighting a dragon is nothing compared to the terrors of a first date.
There's ample reason to stay with this series. When Harry says 'I love magic,' you believe it.
Goblet of Fire promises fans of both the film franchise and the book series a wonderful time in the theater.
Newell's film, unlike its predecessors, fails to generate fresh wonder...but on balance Rowling's creative opus--roiling with hormonal consequences and eye-popping effects--continues to earn its crowds. [Blu-ray]
a superb, swiftly paced fantasy that cleverly balances its incredible events with plenty of adolescent aches and pains that even Muggles can identify with.
For all its small delights and impressive effects..., there's no big payoff -- only the promise of more to come in the fifth movie.
Harry's cup...er goblet... runneth over with magic, suspense, humor and even a hint of romantic tension
There's little to feel wonder towards this time, as danger, insecurity, and awkwardness loom large and overshadow any magical discoveries.
Once Potter ditches scenes that feel taken from Beverly Hills 90210 meets Scooby-Doo, I will approach the series with more than just guarded optimism.
This is another great movie for Mom and Dad to watch with the kids, BUT be warned it is PG-13 this time. I susect the death of a character and the increase of evil acts is the reason for this. If you think your children are prepared for these topics, the
The fourth installment (yes, it never ends) in the series about the little wizard with the round glasses grows so violent and ghoulish that it drains the appeal of stories that are best when they stay innocuous.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is probably the most engaging Potter film of the series thus far.
Goblet of Fire is the second-best of the Potter films.
The strongest film of the bunch.
It's the first Potter movie in which the student characters and their emotional situation is the equal of the special effects, the elaborate settings and the gallery of brilliant British actors in supporting roles.
it's still a lot of fun, but you can sense all of the missing material which makes this Harry Potter not quite up to par with the other three installments.
This is the darkest and most adventurous Potter film to date. Its 156 minutes fly by.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, fourth in the string, has a heated darkness.
Goblet offers its own brew of wondrous chimera combined with the wonders of human nature.
Though the special effects in this film are often breathtaking, the real drama is here is exactly where it should be: in a young man's frightened but resolute eyes.
It's scarier than the previous three movies and more poignant.
In Harry's world, it turns out that the everyday struggles of adolescence are scarier than anything a dark lord -- even one raised from the dead -- can muster. But then, any teenager could tell you that.
It's not until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire that a film has successfully re-created the sense of stirring magical adventure and engaged, edge-of-your-seat excitement that has made the books such an international phenomenon.
A movie that assures us that the journey we are on will be worth the time and emotion that's been invested in it.
More impressive than wondrous, it won't transform the series, but it moves it along, pushing its charges toward adulthood and the mean sorcery of the grown-up world.
Easily the most involving of the movies so far.
The best thing about the picture is Harry's new maturity: For the first time, he dominates a picture named for him.
There's a darkness on the edge of Hogwarts, and its name is adolescence.
As Harry, Ron and Hermione enter the awkward stage, the young people portraying them -- Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson -- grow ever more confident as professional actors.
The visual magic of the story, as well as some enormously welcome glimmerings of humor, gives it the solid feel of a well-tended franchise.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, fourth in the fantasy franchise, is the most fun and the most fraught with conflict.
The film follows in the fantasy tradition of stretching perceptions of the possible, and it does so in a richly realized and recognizably human universe.
It balances the exhilaration of independence -- one of the great joys of growing up -- with the sobering realization that being a grown-up means there's no one around to protect you.
A model of exhilarating, economic storytelling.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire might be the best time you have at the movies all year.
Adolescence is no less sticky a situation for multibillion-dollar movie franchises than it is for young witches and wizards, and what is a Part 4 if not the cinematic equivalent of those awkward tween years?
Goblet shifts effortlessly from dark to light to dark again.
Goblet of Fire is indisputably the best movie in the franchise thus far.
[Newell] balances delicately between whimsy and the ominous, on the uncertain middle ground where Harry lives, poised between fun at school, teenage romance and the dark abyss.
Newell continues to improve on a world that's enthralling to explore ... in spite of the pouting, cheating little dullard at the center of it all.
Here, finally, is a Harry Potter movie that approaches the timelessness of J.K. Rowling's novels.
Harry Potter puts away childish things in Goblet of Fire.
The greatest magic of this book - and this film - is that it doesn't pretend that growing up won't change everything. It's the first Potter film where reality and fantasy are equally fascinating.
While [it] doesn't come close to matching the magic of its predecessor...it's slick and exciting enough to satisfy the fans of the series.
True to the form of previous Potter films, the busy story tends to lose track of characters, hyperactively vaulting from one plotline to the next without satisfying resolutions or transitions.
The first wholly dispensable installment.
The actors play second fiddle to the special effects, and that's not how I like my Harry Potter movies.
It's like this: The book is sensational. The movie is sensationalistic. Both are enjoyable. The book is better.
There is a level of horror operating here that raises this beyond escapist family fare and into the realm of cutting -- heh -- metaphor for teenhood: the agony of adolescence.
Harry Potter's not just for kids anymore. Director Mike Newell has reset the bar for the series and delivered a smashingly dark and dramatic film
The part with the dragon is really cool.
These films just keep getting better and better.
Marvelously directed and artistically without fault, it's the series' most complete and satisfying entry to date on all counts.
The fourth and most boring entry in the franchise.
The direction is phenomenal! Seldom does even a 90-min production come along with such a vibrant pace (this is 150!). A strong film overall, though the climax is a bit weak.
Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the happily satisfying film adaptation of the fourth book in J. K. Rowling's series.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire does have its quota of antic marvels.
A first-class adventure story loaded with spectacle, character, and heart.
Radcliffe is literally and figuratively growing into his role, while Watson shows greater fire and depth. And Grint's rubbery charm is intact.
Harry Potter has become a rare cinematic constant -- something to be anticipated every year or two.
All about how Harry completes three difficult challenges and deals with the rollercoaster ride of adolescent emotions and energies.
Cute no more, Goblet of Fire enchants with a darker aura of suspense and welcomed menace.
This overly long reading from the Rowling scriptures [is] a certain recipe for slumber.
Not just the best Harry Potter movie so far. It's also one of the most entertaining movies of the year.
To this viewer and reader, the decade-old juggernaut is as deeply felt as it is flawed, dense and illogical and laudably weird.
effortlessly sweeps the audience into that enchanted world of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where good and evil are more than just abstract concepts in a dusty old philosophy book
What's amazing about the Harry Potter franchise is that the films get better and better! Or, as Harry puts it, 'I love magic!'
The best Harry Potter picture yet.
Exactly what fans are looking for, offering eye-boggling spectacle and lots of well-executed action scenes.
Now that puberty has struck the Harry Potter universe, the series ought to move away from the insipid kid stuff.
Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire is an endurance test for its audience.
It's hard to resist.
Despite the skill and spectacle of the special effects, the prosaic storytelling is never interesting as cinema.
Welcome to Potter in PG-13... hip, heroic, humorous and... dare I say it? Harry's a hottie!
The first [Potter film] to really get under the skin of these characters. Strip away the CG dragons and sweeping vistas and you'll find Goblet of Fire has just as much impact.
Newell sees to it that the characters who made the 147 minute final cut fully realize Rowling's invention.
The best one yet.
The filmmakers keep the narrative screws fastened tight, which gives The Goblet of Fire an intensity that rarely flags.
The first Brit to direct Harry Potter, Newell brings a sense of anarchy to the school scenes and centers on the rites of passage of his adolescent protags
It seems like only yesterday the three wizardy sprigs were battling giant spiders and cracking conspiracies in the girls' toilets. That knowing comedy keeps this episode sharp.
Newell deftly avoids the mistake of making a kids' movie in which even the worst threat feels safe.
This is a good movie, and a fun movie, but not a great movie. I think Harry's fans are pretty happy with mediocre. At least mediocre isn't bad.


@highlight

The main characters are maturing, and the filmmakers are likewise improving on their craft; vibrant special effects and assured performances add up to what is the most complex yet of the Harry Potter films.
