It's an unconventional movie that's captivating, powerful, and entertaining down to its very last moments.

Field and director Michael Showalter (who also co-writes, with Laura Terruso) find humanity within the humour.
The familiarity of its humour would be easier to forgive if its narrative ambitions weren't equally recognizable.

A affecting comedy that opens our hearts and minds to the plight of the lonely.

Fields -- in nearly every scene -- savors the material and runs with it.
The movie is a bumpy ride at times, but, like Doris, it has its heart in the right place.
Field delivers an artfully measured performance as Doris, first lulling us into believing she'll settle into a goofy stereotype, then stirring up subtle qualities to create a character who is alternately funny and tragic, chipper and anguished.
I'm not sure what this is, beyond a tiresome oddity for the viewer and a career low for its star. Something tells me the most sensible way to deal with Doris is simply not to say hello in the first place.

There are a lot of things that could have gone wrong with this material, but Hello, My Name Is Doris avoids all of the possible pitfalls.
Showalter, whose 2005 romantic comedy "The Baxter" was similarly kindhearted, handles the material with tenderness and care, and never lets it devolve into meanness the way it might in the hands of another director.

This wonderful, silly old fool doesn't need your pity, doesn't require your sympathy. Once she gets under your skin, you understand her completely. And you like her. You really like her.
Though the subplot of Doris' hoarding jumps between hilarious and depressing too jarringly at times, Field nails the anxiety of an overwhelmed senior when a single pencil is moved from its usual place.
Doris may be a convenient cinematic conceit, but Field gives her real juice, moving from a timid wraith to someone who realizes to her amazement that she might be lovable.
A weirdly off-plumb little movie, one that manages to be condescending and compassionate, knowing and blinkered, reassuring and unsettling all at the same time.
Occasional bouts of naughty words aside, this retirement-age comedy is essentially unoffensive, at times touching, and mostly lukewarm.
"Hello, My Name Is Doris" is at times self-consciously quirky and precious and implausible - and Sally Field is so good in it that those complaints seem pointless.

Unlikely as it may be, the relationship begins to seem as plausible to us as to the willfully optimistic Doris, which is a testament to the performers transcending the script's default mode of condescension.
Outrageously funny and captivating, but ultimately undercooked. Sally Field knocks it out of the ballpark with one of the best performances of her career.
Sally Field triumphs in her first full-bodied leading role in a film in years. 'Doris' skillfully walks the line between broad comedy and emotional drama, never missing a beat.
Field proves more than capable of delivering Showalter-level goofiness while giving the film its heart.
If this film had come out near the end of the year, I think that Field would be up for another Oscar (R). What she conveys in her eyes and facial expressions are what make the film a grabber. I think you'll "really like her!"
Doris ...slightly uneven in tempo and tone... while Ms. Field remains at the top of her game and as likable as ever.
Watching Sally Field is one of the pleasures of going to the movies. 'Doris' doesn't always give her the material she deserves. But even when the film fails her, Field never fails to shine.
Some might dismiss this tale of a blooming wallflower as simply a manipulative twee fantasy. But for those of us who trust in Field, this film will have us at "Hello."
A brave little film that shows it's never too late to come of age.
We feel Doris' pain simply because Field is one of the most gifted actors working, capable of being flighty and nervy and deeply sad all at the same moment.
"Hello, My Name Is Doris" ... uses this funny, outwardly ridiculous character to tell a simple story about a love that rarely speaks its name, including in movies: that of an older woman for a much younger man.
Field keeps both hands firmly on the wheel as Doris, skillfully maneuvering through both the comedic and dramatic scenes like the two-time Oscar winner that she is.
At times, "Hello, My Name is Doris" can feel too real, too raw... but it demonstrates the power of decency, kindness, owning up to things, and confronting your own issues.
It's great to see a role for an older woman that doesn't require her to dispense pearls of wisdom or traverse the ravages of dementia - and that acknowledges that people in their 60s (and beyond) still have sex drives.
Sometimes we're clearly meant to laugh at Doris' clumsy efforts at flirtation and socialization, and at others, the director wants us to relate, or maybe even cry, but he can't have everything, which ultimately leaves us with nothing.
Showalter, who wrote the screenplay with Laura Terruso ... puts Doris in so many cringe-worthy situations you wonder if the writers even like this hapless Staten Island cat lady of a certain age.
Field can't make it all make sense, but she does make it diverting, even pleasurable.
Michael Showalter is content to trade They Came Together's mischievous genre deconstructionism for cheap-shot indie quirk.

Not unlike an older woman's wet dream.
As odd as it is enduring, Michael Showalter's Hello, My Name is Doris is a rare character-driven comedy that hinges upon the believability of its central relationship
"Hello, My Name is Doris" effectively conveys the cruel ambivalence of an ageist society, and despite its formulaic ingredients, the movie responds to that setback with Field's exuberant, virtuoso turn providing the ultimate critical response.

Hilarious from start to finish, Hello, My Name Is Doris is likely to be one of the funniest movies of 2015.
Michael Showalter's Hello, My Name Is Doris is a showcase for Field, reminding us that her comedic chops are just as impactful as her flair for the dramatic.
