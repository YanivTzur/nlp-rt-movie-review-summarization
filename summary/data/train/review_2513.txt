I didn't feel the comedic elements always sat well with the rest of the film but that's a small issue with an otherwise gripping, intelligent and suspense-filled thriller.
The film has enjoyed huge word-of-mouth success...yet it ultimately seems too frightened to face down the spectres of modern racism that it rouses. As pure genre entertainment, however, it does deliver sufficient bang.

It's a game-changer.

Peele manages to perfectly balance suspense, humour, and horror while making a hard-hitting political statement about liberal America; a remarkable and timely feat considering the state of the world in 2017.
While it is too violent for my taste, it does have some clever comic touches and an interesting racial twist on the usual horror genre story. It is kind of like a dark comic cross between '12 Years a Slave' and 'The Man With Two Brains.'
Get Out is a great movie for people who dislike or dismiss horror expecting "gratuitous" explicit violence and nudity, because of its humor, PG sex scenes, and the analogies drawn to contemporary lived experiences of race relations.

This is Guess Who's Coming to Dinner meets Six Flags' Kingda Ka roller coaster after surviving a car wreck while winning the lottery.
Like The Stepford Wives before it, Get Out uses a fancifully exaggerated scenario to illustrate real social tensions.
The film wears its influences lightly (The Stepford Wives; the revelation's echo of Being John Malkovich, which starred Keener) even as it camera-tracks the dark side of a supposedly "post-racial" USA.
Precisely because it addresses fears that have been absent from horror movies, Get Out is a future classic.
The sense of dread is palpable throughout, but Peele leavens the fear with a great device in the comedic character of Rod, played by Lil Rey Howery.
It plays and it creates an effective admixture of comedy and intrigue, and it takes dead aim at the zeitgeist in a way that's sure to garner attention ...
Believe the hype, and go see it.

The first must-see film of the year.

Peele clearly knows his genre formulas, but moreover has a keen sense of how to make them speak to the present.
Get Out is an absolutely brilliant and original horror film. Imagine a devilishly twisted update of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Get Out is scary, laugh out loud funny, and an inspired satire of interracial relationships.
Peele draws a draws a subtle, scathing line that connects American imperialism all the way back to its colonial roots, when white men essentially took whatever--and whomever--they wanted.
This one really should be seen with a crowd.
It may be somewhat rough and unrefined and even ill-considered in some of its particulars. Yet it may stand as a kind of pop culture document of this historical moment, a moment that's not nearly as funny as this movie.
Whitford and Keener in particular are having a ball, letting something a little sinister bubble up in their outwardly friendly behavior. But it's Kaluuya who stands out most.
It is not only the best horror film since "Under the Skin," but a subversive and often hilarious commentary on race as well.
It's clever stuff. Still, while I admired the conceptual daring of the movie, I confess I was never actually scared.

Like many of the best horror movies, it provides a grotesque exaggeration to highlight very real social problems.

It's a horror movie in which virtually every element works, starting with Kaluuya's subtle performance.
The deliciously sinister nature of the race dynamics will make you cringe, right up until it gives you the chills.
Ultimately Get Out can't help but ask the question: How would all these white people feel if they could walk in a black person's shoes for a day? And that's something worth considering.
If you're not in the habit of frequenting horror films, this one may be the welcome exception. Get in on Get Out.

Peele has much to say about society and race with an inventive approach that blends chills with a dash of humor.
This is a major filmmaking debut that's fully worthy of all the conversation it will start, both around its commentary on race in America and how truly good it is.
In the same way that The Stepford Wives exploited liberated feminists' fear of male chauvinists' fear of liberated feminists, Get Out finds its tension in black people's fear of white people's fear of black people.
Prudent, muscular filmmaking, a terrifically creepy thriller with a clear voice and plenty to say.
"Get Out" is scary enough, but it comes with some bonus nutritional value.
What's most interesting about Get Out is how it taps into the same idea to fuel both its comedy and horror: the recognition of social truths.

Deeply disturbing
This first-class psychological thriller blending a comedy of manners into full-scale mayhem will appeal to both intellectuals and rank-and-file moviegoers.
Get Out is searing satire, with scary/comic riffs on slavery and assimilation, but it's also a smashing crowd-pleaser of a horror film ...
Only a master satirist like Jordan Peele could take audiences on an insane thrill ride and make us all think about racial stereotyping along the way.

Peele's perfectly tuned cast and deft camera work unleash his uproarious humor along with his political fury; with his first film, he's already an American Bu√±uel.
This is an excellent horror that is gripping, scary, witty and timely, and it's got something to say. Even if you don't think all of it comes off, you will be talking about it.
A horror film with the power to put a rascally grin on the face of that great genre subverter John Carpenter ( They Live ), Get Out has more fun playing with half-buried racial tensions than with scaring us to death.
Get Out takes racism's more traditional forms - slavery, incarceration, exploitation, blackface - for a new, thoroughly modern appropriative spin.
Jordan Peele takes on racism in Get Out and infuses his horrific tale with his signature satirical wit for an experience that's fearlessly bold, hilarious, and an important reminder that we have so much work left to do when it comes to issues of equality.
Peele is sharply perceptive about how racism is so often diminished even by people who allegedly know better, and it's a conceit that serves Get Out incredibly well.
For his sake, I just hope Peele's real in-laws have a good sense of humor.
Biting but good-natured, incisive but not preachy, this is the kind of self-reflective comedy that can bring America together.
Get Out may be deeply flawed, but it's about time Hollywood put some muscle behind a movie that was less interested in flattering audiences than it was in scaring them straight.
A complex, accomplished genre hybrid that should alter Jordan Peele's business card.

Get Out is about as effective as a mainstream comedy can be without veering into truly revolutionary territory.

The third act is just insane. Every little strange thing any character might have said pays off.

With influences ranging from Dario Argento to THE STEPFORD WIVES, Jordan Peele's directorial debut is smart, stylish and scary.
'Get Out' isn't meant to be reassuring. It isn't meant to be conciliatory. It's a bucket of ice water, and it will give you chills.
When microaggressions turn macro... A big-idea film wrapped in a darkly comedic thriller.
This is a confident effort packed with scares and uncomfortable social commentary about race, power, and control.
One of the most satisfying thrillers in several years, Get Out proves that its first-time director, Key and Peele costar Jordan Peele, has plenty of career options if he should grow tired of doing comedy in front of the camera.
