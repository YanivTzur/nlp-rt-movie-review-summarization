Even if the details are askew and presented from an arch comedic angle, it's rare to see a contemporary movie so fully engage with the mundane ways technology affects behavior.
With this kind of Internet-bred micro-celebrity still surprisingly untouched in film and television, Ingrid Goes West feels like a movie we needed.
Thematically, the film delights in the feelings of seeing another person's life and the reasons behind these feelings. [Full review in Spanish]
Fortunately, typecasting or not, Plaza's skills of both comedy and awkwardness are used quite well in Ingrid Goes West a new social dramedy from ... Matt Spicer.
...succeeds just by putting the audience in the middle of that FOMO headspace, where everything good that happens anywhere is an attack, and the only way to get someone to like you is to become the only person they truly appreciate: themselves.
Ingrid is a kind of monster created and enabled by social media. To me, this was a very disturbing movie. Ingrid's mental health problems, her rage and her violent impulses are the least disturbing things about it.
The subject matter becomes a vehicle for salient observations about social ambition, the version of ourselves we choose to present to others, and the nature of friendship.
... the film can't decide whether pursuing validation through social media (by any means necessary) is a good thing; whether Taylor is savvy or soulless; and whether Ingrid is a figure of fun, pity, ingenuity, desperation or horror.
It should make you uneasy in places where Stephen King cannot touch.
Ingrid is the contemporary anti-hero for an image-saturated world, her only transgression being that she takes the false reality of Taylor's Instagram universe too seriously.
Though Spicer's satire brings about some malice, it was still far too saccharine for my taste.
This comedy needed to be made. It has its flaws, but it's better than we had a right to expect.
Matt Spicer has done very well on his first outing.
The picture's greatest asset is its star and producer, Aubrey Plaza, who has a name like a suburban shopping mall and a face like sarcasm personified.
Ingrid is too tragic and disturbing a protagonist to allow for real fun. There are, however, a fine spread of performances (Olsen excels) and much food for thought (never a bad thing).
Everyone is fuel to Ingrid's hunger, and Plaza's gulping performance -- unnervingly and daringly blank, but suggesting deep rivers of desperation -- is almost enough to carry the film.
Ingrid Goes West indulges our worst impulses in the grand quest to gain more likes, followers and attention.
By the time the film builds to a conclusion full of forced conflict, the subtle insight of its early scenes feel as forgotten as a Facebook message you haven't replied to in a month.
The film is very sharp on how young women use social media as self-actualisation, to create intimacy, and to bolster feelings of connection, as well as Instagram's addictive, toxic qualities.
... after an opening montage that ridicules the worst excesses of social-media myth-making ("This is me and my wonderful life!"), the movie has little left to say.
An appealing mixture of black-hearted comedy and plaintive social satire.
An appealing cast gives its all to a highly-charged satire that stays as skin-deep as a selfie.
As with De Niro's deplorable Rupert Pupkin in the similarly themed King of Comedy, you'll find yourself rooting for Aubrey Plaza's psychopathic Ingrid.
Don't worry about having FOMO - there's not much worth seeing here.
Riffing on the likes of Single White Female and The King of Comedy, it's both a sly satire and a skin-crawling exploration of narcissism in the age of Instagram, with Plaza expertly negotiating a tricky role.
Writer-director Matt Spicer makes his feature debut with a horribly enjoyable satire, painted in hard-edged, acrid colours: the colours of an Instragram post, in fact.
The satire here works so well precisely because it is so accurately observed.
A superb satirical swipe at the worst excesses of the social media generation. Deserves a lot of 'likes'.
A very smart take on the stalker movie, which resists easy laughs for harder truths, and might make you think twice the next time you're lining up a photo for social media.
Ingrid Goes West Brings Mental Illness to Forefront in Social Media-Obsessed Culture.
Ingrid Goes West doesn't offer any easy answers, and it's much better for it.

A second-cousin-related twist on Talented Mr. Ripley for the social media era, the pitch-black dramedy skewers LA lifestyle and the vampiric nature of wannabe popularity.
Hits a very specific bullseye ... How Ingrid Goes West affects you will almost certainly depend on your current relationship with social media.

If there's any recent film that has dealt with our craze for social media in the most intelligent and assured of ways, it would be Matt Spicer's "Ingrid Goes West."

Attempts to shade in Ingrid and Dan's tragic backstories are cursory and more than a little clich√©d, but so spot on is the satire that it's hard to imagine this being done better.

This debut feature by Matt Spicer is a piercingly smart satire on the corrosive vapidity of social-media culture.

Aren't we all sometimes guilty of desperately forcing human connection when we feel lonely? Ingrid Goes West suggests we are.

Ingrid's obsessive behavior is the dark matter fueling this comedy, and for about half of the film's brief 97 minutes, we're running on fumes.
The experience is akin to being kneaded by a cat - now soft paws, now sharp claws, alternatingly sweet and deeply uncomfortable.
Fresh, but also meh, unless you like hating everyone. Not Plaza's breakout film.

Doesn't sustain its overview of delusion, but it gets most of the way there, showcasing sharp insight and sly wit as it investigates the madness of exclusion.
Now 33, Plaza can still get away with playing an ingenue (that's what Ingrid is, a toxic ingenue). She can do comedy. She can do drama. She's best of all, as here, at combining both.
The movie explores themes of grief, loneliness and mania that transcend whatever current technology is enabling them.
Plaza's portrayal of Ingrid drives the movie. She creates a character who is desperate, insecure, pathetic and a bit psychotic. Plaza makes you simultaneously feel sorry for Ingrid and uncomfortable being around her.

This semi-indie is a satire, a psycho-comedy and cautionary tale. Though it's not as wicked as some may hope for, it's worthy and occasionally stellar.
The critique is clever but the limit is the one so common in satire: it's hard to care about the fate of a character this exaggerated.

It's timely and relevant, given the increasing number of studies coming out that show the connection between social media use and depression in young users.
It's not by accident that Ingrid is thrust at us with no real back story and no explanation for her behavior. Ingrid may be a blank slate, but aren't we all the minute we click that "Create a New Account" button on a social media app?
If there's just one takeaway, it's that Aubrey Plaza should be front and center as often as possible.

It is entertaining, and often touching, even if it pulls back right when it should be going totally nuts.

Ingrid Goes West has fun with some social media tropes and Southern California tendencies, but it feels less like a satire than a cautionary tale, for both the envious and the envied.
This isn't a simple takedown of social media-obsessed Californians - that would be too easy. Instead, Spicer looks past the emojis and pulls out the depression, inauthenticity and loneliness that's behind the need for constant online affirmation.
Such a vivid and minute portrait of our boho-chic, mid-century modern, reclaimed wood, custom typography, shrub-swilling, microgreens-on-heirloom-quinoa moment that the characters can be outlines, and it doesn't really affect the ride.
Spicer and co-writer David Branson Smith work hard to juggle the bleak tragedy of Ingrid's foolish quest for validation and attention with the quirkiness of their characters.

The comedy social media has wrought and deserves to be put in its place.

Even though this feature debut for director Matt Spicer, who co-wrote the script with David Branson Smith, is sort of all over the place, it's still often sharply amusing, crisply assembled and features game, broad-brushstroke performances ...
It's a troubling character, but she manages to invoke sympathy, without shying away from the real darkness at the center of the story. A movie like Ingrid is a balancing act of tones and styles, and yet, somehow, it barely wobbles.
Nobody plays ambivalence better, and yet, Plaza allows herself to seem vulnerable here. It's just the thing "Ingrid Goes West" needs to cut through that thick-skin ironic veneer of contemporary Hollywood comedy.

A depressingly predictable movie, which is a problem when it's about an essentially unhinged woman.

One of those weird, creepy, unsettling films about obsessions that you just can't help but become a little bit obsessed about yourself.
Plaza's tremendous performance shines, and the script thankfully is as interested in these characters as it is in commenting on social media culture.
Smartly updates the stalker movie for the age of social media.
Part black comedy, part psychological melodrama and part examination of the perils of social media, and it's a lot of other things to boot.
[A] small comedy that hits rare moments of drama ...
The rare that a comedy makes you reconsider your own actions on social media.
