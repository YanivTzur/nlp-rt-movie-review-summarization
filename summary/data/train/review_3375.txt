The only thing I believed in throughout the film was their serene and quite unbelievable aloofness; and the brilliance suggested, not in any wise-guy remarks, but in their faces and bones and distinction.
With chillingly effective performances from the children to add to the tension, this is probably the neatest science fiction film yet to have come out of a British studio.
Compelling, creepy and often unbearably tense.
Village is one of the neatest little horror pictures produced since Peter Lorre went straight.
Commie infiltrators? Bastard aliens? Advertisements for the pill?
This just tapers off from a taut beginning into soggy melodrama.
One of those little science fiction movies that, once seen (and it's a TV staple) is never forgotten.
The script and direction are rather creaky at times, but the children, whose eyes light up menacingly, are excellent.
Very frightening.
A strong and subtle horror film from England.
The atmosphere and pace are superbly handled, and the performances of the sinister, inhumanly intelligent 'children' never falter.
Plays on our dread of our children growing up to become Hitler Youth members with amazing superpowers . . .
Those eyes, those screams! Creepy classic.
It's a humanist piece--no lightning bolt restores this society, just the cool light of right reason.
Creepy stuff
Mildly effective sci-fi thriller that suffers from being too restrained.
Wolf Rilla builds dread of these strange children through insinuation and mood, and the audience gets the real thing: fear
Village of the Damned remains an intelligent creepy tale that has not lost its luster over time.
Can still make contemporary audiences squirm in their seats.

Chilling performances and a restrained, eerie atmosphere make this British horror both an unnerving parable of its era and a timeless classic.
