Lustrous caricature of Hammer frights
Ferdy Mayne is the menacing Dracula , and Sharon Tate , lady in question , looks particularly nice in her bath .
Shot in the Italian Alps , the cinematography is striking .
Funny and scary , this is vintage Polanski .
The film amiably runs through all the standbys associated with vampire movies , putting a personal and goofy spin on most of them .
Nobody laughed .
Infectiously silly vampire farce that 's a lot more elegant than it had to be .
Messy vampire spoof-cum-homage to Hammer , which does n't really come off on either count .
Has its few garlicky moments of delight .
He was evidently only trying to make fun of horror films , forgetting that horror films , played straight , are now more often funny -- unconsciously to -- than horrible .
Early Polanski is a treat .
An elaborate letdown .
Polanski rarely indulged in his taste for overwrought slapstick , but here it is .
Really not as bad as the title ; it IS Polanski
Sporadically inspired .
Macabre , jet-black comedy with Polanski 's unique sensibility in evidence in abundance .
Alternando momentos de humor com outros mais tensos , esta paródia das produções da Hammer conta com ótima direção de arte , excepcional trilha sonora de Komeda , a beleza de Tate , o assustador vampiro de Mayne e direção surpreendente de Polanski .
Benefiting from Polanski 's skewed vision , the film takes on a quality of comic weirdness rarely present in Hammer 's contemporary output .
A moon-drenched eastern European fairy tale perfectly rendered onto film .
redeemed by the movie 's macabre silliness and folkloric atmosphere
An affectionate parody of the Hammer horror films we all know and love from late-night TV .










@highlight

This uneven but amiable 1967 vampire picture is part horror spoof , part central European epic , and 100 percent Roman Polanski , whose signature sensibility colors every frame .
