Lon Chaney created such an empathetic villain that it was nearly impossible not to root for him
Rains , one of my favorite actors , gives a superb interpretation of the mysterious recluse .
Fine version of classic horror/love story/tragedy ... minus music , of course .
If you liked the stage version , you 'll LOVE this version .
Esta luxuosa produção é bem-sucedida ao resgatar a grandiosidade da Ópera , mas falha justamente por permitir que seus valores técnicos transformem o Fantasma em coadjuvante .
If the film never goes full-tilt horror until the somewhat rushed climax , it at least manages to retain a spooky tone , and boasts a few shocks and some exciting scenes . It 's rarely dull .















@highlight

Though it lives beneath the 1925 version , Claude Rains plays title character well in this landmark color version of the classic tragedy .
