Though the film is talky and boring , its moral ethic lesson is compelling even if the hero is n't .
A fitting close to the series .
I suppose the ultimate point is whether or not Frédéric gives in , but the ride itself is quite fascinating .
a beautiful character study about what it is to love one woman and yet be in love with all women
The film builds its emotional structure gradually
A wonderfully cool and lucid exposition of the twists and turns of its hero 's thoughts .
What makes Rohmer 's films so sparkling and intelligent is the way in which he watches his characters . Nothing escapes him , and he uses the angle of a glance , the tilt of a head , the precise set of a mouth , in order to create wonderfully complex characters
Just because Mr. Rohmer keeps his focus short , clear and precise , one sees deeply into the lives of his characters without the sort of pretentious distortions of most movies that deal in metapsors .
At least as moral quandaries go , Love has one worth pondering . And if you feel otherwise , you can at least groove on the 1970s fashions .
-LSB- Rohmer is a -RSB- cerebral French master .
There exists in Chloe 's characters a rare sort of self-reflection , and it 's immensely gratifying to watch in action .
It 's a noteworthy portrait of love , desire and happiness .
An elegant and moral study of yearning in the life of a married man who 's attracted another woman .
One of -LSB- Rohmer 's -RSB- best .
In the couple 's eventual rapprochement , Rohmer argues persuasively for a love illuminated by reason , a sexuality enhanced by self-awareness .






@highlight

Eric Rohmer 's Chloe in the Afternoon does n't need sparkly cinematic dross to discover unspoken , universal truths about relationships and love through filmmaking .
