A bit of filmmaking as film criticism to be respected and admired above and beyond its relationship to the legendary miniseries that it pushed out of print for more than 20 years .
Perhaps this was not the project on which to lavish so many MGM millions . The BBC show was an enchanted cottage ; this is the Las Vegas Grand Hotel .
Almost as if he were directing Pinter , Herbert Ross has actors speak a line , then wait two beats before delivering the next phrase . Technique smothers such ordinarily lively performers as Martin , Peters and Harper .
Not for everyone , but those who respond to it will find it unforgettable .
Underrated , fascinating musical starring Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters .
O ótimo conceito deste musical torna-se ainda mais fascinante graças às belas coreografias , aos ricos figurinos , à impecável direção de arte e , é claro , à magnífica fotografia de Gordon Willis .
Let 's face the music and dance , indeed .
Pennies from Heaven is dazzling and disappointing in equal measure .
The movie , though , is not easy to respond to . It 's chilly without being provocative in any intellectual way .
Dark as night but perfectly lit , a little sad but with a song in its heart .
Potter adapted his immensely successful British TV series into a Hollywood script that maintained most of its intelligence as well as the musical numbers .
Does n't quite work . Enough of it works , however , to give the film a shot , and it does in some ways improve with the passage of time .
A dazzling downer of a musical
he point is made endlessly , though it 's in the film 's favor that it 's made with seriousness , consideration , and a certain amount of imagination .
How cynical can a musical be ?
