Three 30-somethings relive their gloriously lurid college days for one night only in Radu Muntean 's Boogie , a restrained and honest look at the male midlife crisis in an embryonic state .
Hampered by pacing that borders on glacial , the performances infuse the story with lingering melancholy .
Naturalistic performances , long takes , unfussy edits and a story that unfolds over a few hours are all present and correct .
Small but sharp and extremely well observed .
An impressive chamber piece by a director who needs watching .
This is a tough , shrewd , intelligent movie .
This is superior film-making , equally comfortable with the light -LRB- Boogie 's obvious delight in his nipper and the realistic family dynamic -RRB- to the dark -LRB- his risibly macho deceipt with a jolly hooker -RRB- .
It may not scale the heights of the best recent Romanian films -LRB- 4 Months , 3 Weeks & 2 Days , The Death Of Mr Lazarescu -RRB- but Boogie is still a bittersweet character study .
The film remains dour , truthful , grimly droll .
Superbly acted , sharply observed and impressively directed Romanian drama , though it drags a little in the early stages .
