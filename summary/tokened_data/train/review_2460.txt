McDowell 's affectionate , mischievous impersonations and clips from Anderson 's body of work make for an easy couple of hours .
An uncinematic form , perhaps , but of absorbing interest to cinema-lovers .
His account of Anderson 's demise moves , but by then , this arch-raconteur 's bluster may have sand-papered your patience .
Affectionate , mischievous and informative , it 's a rewarding insight into one of Britain 's largely forgotten celluloid heroes .
It 's not great cinema , but it 's never less than good fun ; watch it in conjunction with Anderson 's recently published diaries , and you 'll get a sense of a unique , irreplaceable and finally very human talent .
Whether it can justify a bigger release remains to be seen , though it 's gossipy and amusing , and McDowell incidentally shows no strain in carrying such a long solo stage piece .
For anyone interested in the life and work of Lindsay Anderson , however , and indeed the British New Wave more generally , Never Apologize is an illuminating piece of film .
There 's plenty of fascinating material here , yet many of the anecdotes fall flat .
Malcolm McDowell is thoroughly engaging in Never Apologize : A Personal Visit With Lindsay Anderson .
The film Never Apologize ... does n't sound like compelling viewing . But when the man on the stage is actor Malcolm McDowell and his subject is British filmmaker Lindsay Anderson , the viewing is entertaining and touching .
But the actor too earnestly prolongs readings from the director 's diaries and letters , turning the experience into more of an undisciplined airing of bitchy candor .

Essentially a stage production of Malcolm Macdowell musing over his departed friend , and brit director Lindsey Anderson . Macdowell makes for an engaging raconteur , but only for Anderson fans .
