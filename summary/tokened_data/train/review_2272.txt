What it does manage to say -- be it about community , tolerance , gay masculinity or most obviously , the concept of inevitability -- it puts across beautifully and poignantly .

It 's one of those rare films that actually hits you the hardest the moment it finishes , when , all of a sudden , you realise what it is that you 've actually been watching .
We 've seen movies and television about this sort of man before , and one of Moonlight 's strongest assets is the way it refines this character type , subverting the narrative .
There 's possibility in every moment , as you see when Chiron reconnects with the grown Kevin -LRB- Andre Holland -RRB- , and those moments keep accumulating until Moonlight is an unforgettable vision of love and acceptance .
The performances are all very good indeed , and the film 's serious , concerned tone suits the subject matter .
What begins as an arresting blend of lyrical storytelling and bad-neighbourhood harshness gradually ferments into a relentlessly melancholic dirge in dire need of somewhere to go ... an early contender for the most overrated film of the year .

There are too many quality aspects , particularly the performances , to ignore this film , which has stimulated much discussion .
Moonlight defies more than the movies . It defies the way we identify ourselves as well . If you 're looking for shorthand , call it the portrait of a person . Say it 's also beautiful to behold , and brilliant .
Jenkins does n't just show us the experience of his young protagonist , he bathes us in it .
Coming together with a pace that is deliberate but never sluggish , Moonlight is a beautifully human cinematic experience , and something to behold .
Moonlight depicts an American story of which America needs to be reminded .

Little if any of this covers any real new ground , but there 's something about the way Jenkins has assembled & presented it that makes the story , characters , & themes feel fresh . -LRB- Full Content Review - Violence , Profanity , etc. - also Available -RRB-

A powerful , timely tale of lost youth .
Jenkins ' ensemble might be the year 's finest , with Naomie Harris , as the boy 's crack-addicted mother , and likely winner Mahershala Ali , as a kindly drug dealer , of all things , surely to earn Best Supporting Actress and Actor noms , respectively .
It 's only Jenkins ' second feature , but Moonlight feels more like a hard-earned career-capper rather than the career-igniter that it should become .
Moonlight is one of the most poignant , poetic and beautiful movies of the year .
If you 're looking for a moving story , artfully told by a filmmaker on the rise , Moonlight certainly warrants the hype .
It 's somehow hard to define great direction-it 's easier to define its absence-but Jenkins is surely a great director . He 's got it all and more .
I 'm in love with these characters . I ca n't stop thinking about them . And I ca n't wait to see this movie again .
One of the year 's most provocative and sensitive films . And one of the best .
Moonlight takes the concept of the bildungsroman to its natural end point in ways that many coming-of-age stories do n't .
Luminous and plaintive , Moonlight is emotional virtual reality , transforming a unique human experience into something universal and unforgettable .

The visuals are lush , the performances are lived-in , and the story is lyrical , if painstakingly subdued .
An anguished , achingly affecting , incandescent , coming-of-age story - shattering stereotypes of the LGBTQ community .
Black lives matter in the quiet , contemplative Moonlight , but let 's not stop there .
Gay coming-of-age melodramas are common enough , but this is uncommon on most every level -- extraordinary , one of the best pictures of the year .
Moonlight is both a disarmingly , at times almost unbearably personal film and an urgent social document , a hard look at American reality and a poem written in light , music and vivid human faces .

A unique , brilliantly acted twist on an indie coming-of-age film .
This is n't simply Jenkins ' sophomore effort -- it 's the defining pivot of his career , and one of 2016 's most essential pictures .
-LSB- Moonlight recalls -RSB- works from filmmakers as varied as Richard Linklater , Fran√ßois Truffaut , Fernando Meirelles , Cheryl Dunye and Spike Lee . But , in the end , the director makes this motion picture its own uniquely satisfying enterprise .
Jenkins lets the scenes play out with organic ease , and cinematographer James Laxton physicalizes the locations with a kind of off-kilter poetry .
Moonlight 's best moments come in Little 's reaction to Juan 's affection , but later scenes of Chiron 's erotic confusion and Black 's maudlin self-pity -LRB- he wears muscular drag yet succumbs to weakness -RRB- insist that viewers feel sorry for black gay males .
Jenkins accomplishes a feat of narrative genius . The three stories of Little , Chiron , and Black , could exist separately as shorts ... Still , we see them as one character in different stages .

Chiron 's life experiences have almost all been bad but , in the end , the character is given a glimmer of hope and possible happiness .
Truly , madly , deeply : There 's magic in this Moonlight .
Bullying , poverty , closeted sexuality , drug abuse , and racial strife combine to form an overworked agenda of cultural woes that 's more concerned with rubber-stamping issues than telling an original story .
In its quietly radical grace , it 's a cultural watershed - a work that dismantles all the ways our media view young black men and puts in their place a series of intimate truths .
A deeply personal and visually mesmerizing drama that just might be the year 's best movie .
As good as -LSB- Hibbert , Sanders and Rhodes -RSB- all are , it is Holland who makes the strongest impression , the director 's alter ego in guiding this young man towards the light .
Touching and disturbing , avoiding clich√©s , shattering stereotypes and succeeding from every angle .
It 's less a story than a collection of moments , which leaves its viewer feeling moved and changed , as if you 've spent time in someone else 's dreams and woke up understanding who they are .
It may cast a spell on anyone who has known loneliness , exclusion , feelings of inferiority or a desire to be encased in a hard shell to protect a soft interior .
If you 're patient enough to stick with it , the emotional payoffs are profound .
Moonlight is a story that needed to be told and is achingly beautiful every step of the way .
Every piece of Moonlight is staged in service to a humanist question : What would love mean to a boy who 's been conditioned to hide ?
The film soon moves from the familiar to the foreign , becoming a textured exploration of black masculinity and coming-of-age that plumbs beyond clich√©s and stereotypes .
A decidedly-dystopic , African-American answer to the relatively-sedate , suburban bildungsroman served up by Boyhood !
`` Moonlight '' is a minor miracle , a movie that mines beauty out of the ugliest situations , and a glimmer of hope from heartbreak .
If you think art should challenge us , then you will embrace writer-director Barry Jenkins ' exquisitely crafted drama Moonlight . It 's a true American masterpiece and one of the best films of the decade .
Aided by beautiful , stereotype-shattering performances and subtle but rich cinematography , it is something heartfelt , stirring and unforgettable .
... lit with what can only be described as the aching color of compassion .
This is a humane movie , one that 's looking to prompt empathy and introspection most of all . On those terms , Moonlight is one of the year 's most gripping viewing experiences .
Honest and realistic exploration of one man 's journey from a neglectful childhood to adulthood and finding his own - highly personal - way in the world . The main character happens to be black and gay .
This is a vivid and tremblingly lived-in portrait of young black manhood and sexuality , rendered with genuine power and grace . I 've never seen anything quite like it , and most moviegoers probably have n't either .
Barry Jenkins ' second feature is basically Boyhood if it had been made about , well , someone else . That does n't even begin to unpack the layers and resonances in this startling drama
So few unexploitative movies are made about young black men , especially young black gay men , that the overpraise for this frail , sweet , discursive fantasia is understandable -- and forgivable .
It just needs to be watched and embraced , as an entirely fresh example of the power that great movies can exert on our lives .
Directing , screenwriting , acting , cinematography and music combine superbly in the movie , which is based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney and has been compared to Richard Linklater 's Boyhood and Charles Burnett 's Killer of Sheep .
Perhaps other great films will be released between now and the end of the year , but I honestly ca n't imagine any being as worthy as Moonlight for every top prize .
What 's most wondrous about Moonlight is that it 's an uncommonly small story that has so much going on . Beautiful filmmaking on every level -LRB- Splice Today -RRB-
... an intriguing yet erratically-paced character study .
Barry Jenkins 's excellent Moonlight is a film filled with bittersweet ironies .

Consider the thin and thick wallops of blue ... Blue , blue , electric blue . Lazy blue . Electrified blue . Wash of water . Ice-blue buzz of fluorescence . Azul , azure , lapis lazuli , teal , turquoise , sea , seafoam , sky , cerulean , cobalt ...
Moonlight , then , is subtle and evocative , as much a sensory experience as a linear journey .

It 's a coming-of-age story that admits no one ever truly comes of age . We make choices and change shapes .
Hopefully it does n't take Jenkins another eight years to make a film . But we can take comfort in the very strong likelihood that , even if it does , it will be well worth the wait .

He takes a while getting there sometimes , but director Barry Jenkins combines the personal and the political better than almost anyone .

It 's a touching film that sensitively explores one person 's search to find out who he is .
Deeply affecting , Moonlight is a small , beautifully told story that resonates well beyond the time spent in the theater .
Jenkins ' emotionally resonant and ambitious approach to filmmaking allows the picture to outshine its shortcomings .
Well-acted with exquisite cinematography and has its fair share of poignant moments , but it falls short of reaching the heights of powerful coming-of-age classics like Boyhood .
Exhilaration and melancholy are dispensed in equal doses by Moonlight , destined to be one of the better-reviewed films of this year , and for good reason : It 's a masterpiece -- an overused word , but not the wrong one .

Moonlight tells a coming-of-age story in passages , each possessed of enough stand-alone power to operate as a wonderful short film , even as the whole proves much greater than the sum of the parts .
Jenkins mounts no soapboxes and brandishes no manifestos in his attempt to illuminate the inner life of this troubled boy turned teenager turned man . Instead he shows us the love that other characters feel for Chiron ...
Easily one of the most personal and most powerful films of the year .
Barry Jenkins ' game-changer about growing up black , gay and alienated in the Miami projects is both intimate and epic . It gets inside your head , makes you see the world with new eyes - and then it owns you .
Moonlight is a film so measured , so delicate and powerful , that it proves to be sensitive in ways most movies are n't , even in ways most of life is n't .
`` Moonlight '' is magic .
A question is posed to the main character of Barry Jenkins 's wondrous , superbly acted new film , Moonlight : `` Who is you , man ? ''
Hype would bruise Barry Jenkins 's Moonlight , which is so delicate in its touch that the usual superlatives sound unusually shrill . It 's the gentlest , most suggestive of great films .
A work of art all its own , thoughtfully made and deeply affecting .
Floridly shot , richly humanistic drama about a young man coming of age in a rough Miami slum tangles with love , violence , identity , addiction and sexuality .
By the end , calling `` Moonlight '' an `` important '' film seems like an insult . It 's even better than that .
This achingly beautiful coming of ager leaves its mark on both heart and soul .
`` Moonlight '' glows .
A remarkable drama about a young black American man wrestling with his sexuality in a society already prejudiced against him because of the colour of his skin .
An elegiac , raw , painful film that explores the strangeness of growing up gay in Miami 's black community in the 1980s .
A nuclear-fission-strength heartbreaker . It 's made up of moments so slight and incidental they 're sub-molecular - but they release enough heat and light to swallow whole cities at a stroke .
Moonlight surprised me . Then it rattled me to my core . And finally , it nestled snuggly inside my heart .
An astonishing film from Barry Jenkins . One of the best films of recent years .
It 's astutely judged , beautifully humane and , in its final throes , devastatingly romantic .
Under Jenkins ' direction , Moonlight is both haunting and poetic , a bittersweet elegy for what could have been . His unflinching camera , which tends to follow the film 's characters like a ghost , gives the film a startling immediacy and emotional power .
Jenkins has an extraordinary eye for ordinary spaces , the contexts within which his characters must define themselves .
A drama that 's as frustrating as it is innovative in its storytelling decisions .
Moonlight feels almost as prescient as it is heartbreaking -- which is to say , profoundly .
Moonlight moves for a while in heady bursts , like memories rushing back .
What tends to right Moonlight , even when Barry Jenkins 's filmmaking drifts into indulgence , is the strength of its actors .
An emotional but discrete drama about the acknowledgement of homosexuality in an African american young man . -LSB- Full review in Spanish -RSB-
Acting as urban cinema 's `` Brokeback Mountain '' and `` Boyhood , '' it 's as if we got to see `` Ennis '' and `` Mason '' grow up in a different culture and era . In this case , it 's even more powerful and profound .
Moonlight is proof that stories which are more specific and focused on idiosyncrasies and particulars of individuals are often more equipped to effectively engender universal responses .
It is thrilling , sensuous stuff .
Humane and deeply moving .
With repressed men of all races increasingly finding reason to lash out , Moonlight asks us to put down our arms and open our hearts .
The work of a major film-maker and not just a promising one .
A staggering work .
The acting elevates the clich√©s of Barry Jenkins 's script into something approaching lived truth .
That rare film that seems to wholly capture a human experience , in all of its tragedy and wonder .
Understated and thought-provoking .
Moonlight is mesmerically , sometimes swooningly , shot and scored , and well-acted all round too .
A memorable drama that analyzes the way we relate with each other under modern society standards . -LSB- Full review in Spanish -RSB-
One of Moonlight 's remarkable strengths is how completely it avoids preaching , after-school messaging , or pat cinematic answers .
One of the year 's best films , one of those movies that sneaks up on you and packs a wallop in the end .
Leaves you feeling both stripped bare and restored , slightly better prepared to step out and face the world of people around you , with all the confounding challenges they present . There 's not much more you can ask from a movie .
Moonlight is a film that is both lyrical and deeply grounded in its character work , a balancing act that 's breathtaking to behold .
Moonlight is a quietly introspective depiction steeped in unparalleled honesty of the ways in which we 're saved and damned throughout our lives .
A masterpiece of poetic filmmaking , Moonlight is one of the most powerful films of the year .
Moonlight takes the pain of growing up and turns it into hardened scars and private caresses . This film is , without a doubt , the reason we go to the movies : to understand , to come closer , to ache -- hopefully with another .
Moonlight is a beautiful piece of filmmaking .
Jenkins balances raw honesty with dreamy imagery and keeps his narrative loose , riding emotional beats instead of getting trapped inside a finite beginning and end . That is exactly how it should be .
A triptych illustrating the tidal ebb and flow of identity , Jenkins 's film is awash in dreaminess , while still examining the life of one young man with piercing clarity .
Moonlight is always in tension with itself . Sometimes it wins and turns into something absolutely , rapturously lovely . Sometimes it loses .
There 's warmth and tension in every frame , mostly from characters trying to find the right words or motions to express themselves .
An indelible portrait of an imperilled life , `` Moonlight '' is a devastating depiction of masculinity , race and identity . Ambitious in scope but precise in its execution , this deceptively small-scale character piece reverberates with compassion and insight .
A rarely seen portrait of what it really means to be a black gay man in America today . It 's a stunning achievement .
Glows like its title .
Barry Jenkins ' vital portrait of a South Florida youth revisits the character at three stages in his life , offering rich insights into the contemporary African-American experience .
The story 's power comes from the gaps between words - and an ongoing battle to find the right ones .
Jenkins and McCraney have artfully cobbled together something that is impressionistic and wondrous , like a compendium of half-remembered memories , tinged by sadness .
There have simply not been enough films about the gay experience of African-Americans or other people of color for that matter . Is is not hyperbole to note Barry Jenkins ' magnificent new drama `` Moonlight '' is a historic achievement in this regard .
