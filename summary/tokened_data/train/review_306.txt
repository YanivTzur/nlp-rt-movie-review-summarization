Sharon Stone goes cold in this botched thiller-maybe from the effort of pretending that her character , a beauteous book editor , would fall for the preening young computer wizard played by the vacant-and-proud-of-it William Baldwin .
... stripped of its thriller elements , the movie is really just a subpar 9Â 1/2 Weeks clone ...
Director Phillip Noyce 's camera will leer at anything that clenches and unclenches with a steady rhythm .
A glossy , trashy psychological thriller that manages to entertain despite a reshot ending which is too abrupt .
A hot follow-up to `` Basic Instinct '' ... just as sizzling
Horrible .
Stone and Noyce fall from grace .
` You like to watch do n't you ' ... that may be true , but I would have liked watching even more if I were watching something better .
Sliver has a few mildly memorable moments , but is for the most part a waste of time . It is indicative of the poor career choices Sharon Stone made once she became a household name .
Silly title aside , `` Sliver '' does have , at its best , one of the most unconventional endings in recent memory . At its worst , it 's just not very interesting .

















@highlight

Sliver is an absurd erotic thriller with technobabble and posits prime Sharon Stone as a professional book nerd .
