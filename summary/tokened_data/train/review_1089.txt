A strange , wounded beast , filled with wonderful sequences and homemade charm , but also confused and anticlimactic .
Explorers itself is bubble-thin , but it glides by gracefully on the charm of its three young heroes and their vividly envisioned adventure in space .
Their space trip may be familiar , but they make it fun .
Without an interesting story or characters , special effects are n't enough to sustain a feature film .
The offbeat teen comedy gets off to a good start , but when it takes off in space the spoof becomes too alien to be anything more nourishing than junk food for the soul .
The birth of fanboy culture ?
It looks terrific , moves along at a gallop , and is marvellously good-natured .
A terrific little kid flick
The one that started it all ! Started what ? No idea !
A family feature on Acid . What a strange , strange film .
An enjoyable , quintessentially 1980s science-fiction adventure , full of wit and crafty pop culture references .
Explorers , ' which is lively but largely familiar until the point when it reaches its batty pinnacle , frequently shows off Mr. Dante 's sense of humor to good advantage .
After so much build-up , the ending 's a bit of a letdown , but as a kids flick , this is way above average .
Hardly out of this world , but a pleasing spinkle of space dust
A fun-time nostalgic trip into outer space .
The movie 's pleasures are obvious and considerable .
Explorers remains a hopelessly schizophrenic film , obscenely eager to compromise its own originality .

With a terrific young cast -LRB- including Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix -RRB- and some typically energetic work from director Joe Dante , Explorers soars past its '80s kiddie flick competitors with wit , good-looking effects , and tons of charm .
