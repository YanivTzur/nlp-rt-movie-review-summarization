It 's a teen thriller , practically aimed at that audience , but includes fights ... bullying and , yes , a romantic story . -LSB- Full review in Spanish -RSB-
-LSB- The -RSB- positives are n't really enough to make iBoy feel like much more than another teen sci-fi . It 's a thrill ride up to a point , but there are many films that do what it 's doing better and with more heart .
Violent book-based thriller has cursing , mature themes .
iBoy is a fully charged superhero tale that soon overcomes its admittedly ludicrous premise .
The film 's secret superhero is Maisie Williams as Lucy .
Even if this were the place to discuss such matters , director Adam Randall -LRB- adapting Kevin Brooks 's novel -RRB- has little new to say .
iBoy is a sparky film , embedded in London 's cheek-by-jowl world of wealth and poverty . It 's also a dark teen drama , peppered with brutal beatings , gang rape , drugs and dead bodies .
There is a persistent and disconcerting joylessness about this .
Entertaining High-concept superhero movie with some glaring pacing issues .
iBoy has an original-enough concept , taken from a book by Kevin Brooks , but any freshness is muffled by the dated gangster movie clichés peppered throughout the script .
iBoy misses out on the opportunity for entertaining mischief with a po-faced approach to the material and a lack of internal logic to the story .

@highlight

iBoy 's original premise and Maisie Williams ' strong performance are n't enough to overwrite a clichéd narrative , too-serious tone , and overall glitchy execution .
