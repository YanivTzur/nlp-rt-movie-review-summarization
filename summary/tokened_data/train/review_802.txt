Another entry in violent , played-out sci-fi series .
The Fourth Awakens proves merely another piece of dreary detritus to take up residence at the bottom of the pop-culture barrel .
Things just were n't as fun this time around .
Whatever absurd delights this series once could boast have long since been stripped of their tiny joys and ground into dust by the weight of encroaching , ceaseless , incredibly cynical commercialism .
Long gone is Parts 1 and 2 's wry delivery of witty-ish dialogue , replaced instead with expected gags - save for an actually engaging scene where Fin and April sorted through the subterfuge and lies they each had been fed during her five-year absence .
What was once a guilty pleasure has now said farewell to the pleasure part of that equation , and what 's left is just so much light and noise that sweeps away the things to appreciate .
The 4th Awakens gives off the impression that the Sharknado franchise has locked into groove where it can give its fans more to talk about on social media while staying true to its B-movie creature feature/disaster film roots .
Even if you hate these movies , you have to at least kind of admire the mythology it 's tried to carve ...
While fans of the series may get something out of the sequel , there is nothing on display that could possibly sway naysayers .
What can you say about a film in which Gary Busey -- yes , that Gary Busey -- turns in the best performance?This franchise finally jumps the sharknado .
With Sharknado : The 4th Awakens , this B movie series most definitely - wait for it - jumps the shark .
Part four becomes a full-on superhero movie and who does n't want to see a Sharknado version of a superhero movie ?

@highlight

Sharknado : The 4th Awakens loses the ridiculous charm of its predecessors , leaving only clumsy social commentary and monotonous schtick that 's lost its bite .
