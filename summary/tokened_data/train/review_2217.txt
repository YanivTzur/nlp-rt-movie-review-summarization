The intrigue is in the details that initially passed you by . The men , for instance , are all army veterans . They address each other by rank and their booze-fuelled camaraderie seems to be an expression of their status .
a classic film with plenty of spunk
Chummy caper comedy , mainly for Rat Pack fanciers .
There are many incidental pleasures to be had .
Considering the iconic status of all involved , the result is disappointing .
Sinatra , Davis , and Martin performed their club acts at night and worked on this Las Vegas-set film during the day , and the good time they were having fairly jumps off the screen .
Laboring under the handicaps of a contrived script , an uncertain approach and personalities in essence playing themselves , the production never quite makes its point , but romps along merrily unconcerned that it does n't .
Terminally boring .
The heist itself , though , is a superb piece of movie-making .
One suspects that the most memorable moments occurred off-camera .
Young people are likely to find this more appropriate and bewitching than do their elders . The latter are likely to feel less gleeful in the presence of heroes who rob and steal .
Sluggishly paced , shoddily staged , and featuring a plot full of inconsistencies
At least as entertaining as the remake . Probably better .
Tepid . The idea is so much better than the execution .
A heist flick that counts on its coolness -- and a remarkably downbeat ending -- for its success .
Think of it as an ancient-history lesson in the social evolution of long-extinct male dinosaurs .
The original Ocean 's is fun , fun , fun .
There are just too many main characters for any of them to develop any depth , too many shots of casino signs sparkling in the night , and too little pace and plot to pull the whole thing together .
Implausible yet wholly unforgettable

Easygoing but lazy , Ocean 's Eleven blithely coasts on the well-established rapport of the Rat Pack royalty .
