Visceral .
In some ways , The Hurt Locker defies the conventional narrative pattern of cinema . Bigelow 's work must be seen as a power-packed punch that lands right on your face .
Satisfying from the first frame to the last , The Hurt Locker ranks among the most accomplished contemporary war films .
Depicting that toll fairly , and soldiers as flawed people with doubts and fears as well as triumphs , deepens our understanding of war . Still , Hurt Locker probably wo n't change anyone 's interpretation of current events .
In spite of the lack of historical perspective , Kathryn Bigelow 's The Hurt Locker manages to be a completely engrossing war film .
This may not represent the absolute reality of conflict in Iraq , but Bigelow has fashioned a gut-wrenching , gripping piece of suspense cinema that seeks to grab you by the neck .
Although more a film about the Iraq war , it 's a film about any war , about the tensions and panics experienced by human beings in a warlike conflict . -LSB- Full Review in Spanish -RSB-
Based on the experiences of the journalist Mark Boal , who lived with a patrol similar to the one that 's featured in The Hurt Locker , the film finds a perfect channel in its episodic structure ... -LSB- Full review in Spanish -RSB-
Bigelow masterfully narrates the work of these professionals who face death every day , several times a day ; and concentrates on the minimal and essential details of life on the front . -LSB- Full review in Spanish -RSB-
This may be the same sun-bleached Iraq of dusty dirt streets and open deserts we 've seen in other Iraq war films , but it 's a different kind of movie . Director Kathryn Bigelow 's handheld camerawork roams like a spotter 's eyes ...
The Hurt Locker is without a doubt one of the best war pictures I have ever seen , and I have seen most of them .
I probably should have seen this movie when I had the chance in theaters , but as a DVD it did n't live up to the hype , though it was well done .
As a war movie the film ... is content to ply the old standbys , such as the men in the trenches who understand the reality of the war , the effete desk-bound commanders who offer useless advice , and the civilians who exist merely as cannon fodder .
We may not like Staff Sgt. James all that much , but those of us who get our adrenaline fixes at the movies can recognize a bit of ourselves in him .
More than anything , The Hurt Locker is a high-wire study of men at work , its lack of overt politics replaced by a revelatory central performance .
One of the best-made films of 2009 .
There is much that is fiercely modest about its ambitions . And , for a war film , it is often disconcertingly quiet .
This is a harrowing picture , made all the more disturbing because it 's based in a war that is being waged right now .
An important , intense , nail-biting experience -- really quite unforgettable .
The idea of watching people risking being blown to smithereens might not create a box office blockbuster . But this is certainly director Kathryn Bigelow 's best film since Point Break in 1991 .
Locker is merciless in its wretched view of life during wartime . IEDs , suicide bombers , even old-school sniper fire -- all these things are around to remind soldiers that death is imminent at any waking minute .
The Hurt Locker succeeds where others have n't , putting you in the boots of highly trained Army personnel . And since they 're experts at defusing bombs , it 's understandable if you shake in them .
It is visceral filmmaking at its best .
The movie pays off so well because it places you fully in the shoes of the men , from their fears and obsessions to their paranoia about virtually every Iraqi citizen they encounter .
A sudden , extended sniper attack , coming midway through the movie , is the best sequence I 've seen on film this year .
One of the best war movies I 've seen .
I think the film works really well precisely because they do n't try to build up some phony narrative arc to hang the whole thing on . The film is very slice-of-life , very observational .
There are plenty of things in Hurt Locker that may tempt you to cover your ears and hide your eyes . If you do , you 'll be missing one of the year 's best movies .
Boal 's script discovers the hollow inside the brave James : the missing part that made him never stop to realize why he did his job . That final revelation is smart filmmaking .
The Hurt Locker is set in present-day Baghdad , but it could be taking place anywhere in the world , at virtually any time in the last century .
The Hurt Locker is amazing as a thoughtful action movie but merely really , really darn good as a character study .
It 's a film about why some soldiers love war , a theme that 's rare in war films made by men .
Bigelow 's constantly moving camera , often jittery and restless , does well to convey the tension and latent chaos that bubbles beneath the surface of these soldiers ' lives .
The Hurt Locker becomes like many wars ; a nerve-wracking experience without solid answers for the core question of why we 're there .
The Hurt Locker has been surrounded by Oscar hype since the film was released overseas months ago , and with good reason : it is masterpiece of suspense .
It is neither an anti-war film nor a pro-war film . It is , simply , a great war film about courageous men working in chaotic situations , and the collateral damage that comes with the job .
If you walk into a screening of Kathryn Bigelow 's The Hurt Locker with a set of fulsome fingernails , expect to leave with stubs . If you 're a chronic nail biter , except to leave with half your fingers gnawed off .
The Hurt Locker is a masterwork of filmmaking and without rhetoric , reminds us -LRB- again -RRB- that war may be politics by other means but it is always murder .
This is a film that does n't distract with big self-aggrandizing political statements , but nevertheless succeeds in nailing the horror of the war .
If you have a chance to see it , you should n't hesitate to do so .
Not only the best film made so far about the war in Iraq , but also one of the best thrillers of the year .
The Hurt Locker transcends the political slop surrounding Iraq and cuts straight to the bone , letting us touch the hard , bloody reality of war without casualties of cliche or naive acts of emotional heroism .
Bigelow , one of the very few women working in the traditionally male-dominated action and war genres , avoids both red wire/yellow wire clich√© and political preaching to deliver a film that is as psychologically fascinating as it is taut and exciting .
The Hurt Locker is not a conventional approach to wartime heroics but rather a penetrating and harrowing examination of war 's unrelenting damage on the human psyche .
The Hurt Locker is horrifying . It 's hopeless . I want to go see it again .
Her new film , The Hurt Locker , is both a structuralist war movie-it could be titled ` Seven Instances of Dismantling an Improvised Explosive Device ' - and a totally immersive , off-the-charts high-anxiety experience from beginning to end .
This is an outstanding war film because it 's aware that it 's a film , not a polemic .
When the picture is n't ramping up your heart rate , it switches gears and becomes an intimate character study in what war does to humankind .
It 's in refusing to plant a flag on one side or the other over the Iraq war debacle that Bigelow may just have made the conflict 's defining film : words are cheap , but it 's action that matters .
I was n't exactly blown away by it -LRB- no pun intended here at all -RRB- , but it remains an engaging film . There 's certainly a great story to be told in here somewhere , it 's just not the great film I 've been hearing about .
It 's not delicate by any means , and it gives an intense look into the lives of the American soldiers in Iraq .
Director Kathryn Bigelow , doing her run - 'n' - gun best , does n't mine traditional suspense so much as impart a queasy feeling of monotony .
The suspense may just kill you .
Kathryn Bigelow 's The Hurt Locker is one of the most thrilling action films I 've seen in the past few years . It features set piece after pulse-quickening set piece .
The decade 's best fictional film about its real war , it 's a unique perspective on the workplace high of delivering containment from chaos . Some people kick PowerPoint 's ass . Sgt. 1st Class William James saves his by defusing bombs .
Jeremy Renner as the unhinged James is a revelation .
-LSB- The Hurt Locker -RSB- should be remembered at Oscar nomination time , both for performances -LRB- James Renner and Anthony Mackie -RRB- , script and director .
There is something original and distinctive about the film 's willingness to admit that for some men -LRB- and many moviegoers -RRB- war carries an intrinsic dramatic charge .
A riveting look at the day-to-day life of a U.S. army bomb-disposal unit stationed in Baghdad , this is the kind of emotionally charged drama that 's traditionally released in the fall . Not that you wo n't be grateful to see it now .
Bigelow does not stint on portraying war 's brutality , but the focus is strictly on the individual , not on the bigger picture , and the overall effect is more powerful and devastating for it .
Equal parts bravado-fueled action and pointed political statement . The best film yet made about the Iraq War , and the best American film about war since Platoon .
One of the few must watches of the year so far , and certainly one of the most intelligent offerings , The Hurt Locker would likely already be boasting a masterpiece label had it been from a high profile director or studio .
The opening scene alone may well be the most insanely gripping and amazingly constructed cinematic moment you 'll see all year .
Combines white - knuckle tension , sizzling dialogue and poignant insight into the lives of the bravest guys in Baghdad .
A tense , occasionally meandering story about bomb defusers in Iraq .
May be to the War on Terror what Apocalypse Now is to Vietnam , and it 's almost as hallucinatory a vision .
While Kathryn Bigelow 's taut direction is Academy Award-worthy , Mark Boal 's script does n't get far enough beneath the characters ' skin .
Succeeds where so many others have failed , by crafting a compelling Iraq war film .
A must-see film with gripping performances and vivid evocation of urban warfare in Iraq .
With politics and philosophy largely absent from James 's tour of extreme duty , it settles into a somewhat comforting pattern of danger and mild relief , which can diffuse the knots in your stomach .
Beautifully shot , well acted , and completely unfocused to the point of , well , what was the point ? ... do n't be fooled .
The film hurts like hell as we sit on the edge of our seats enveloped in tension
The fact that Bigelow could make such a realistic war movie without the actual combat experience that directors like William Wellman had makes this even more remarkable .
Salta de uma seq√º√™ncia a outra com fluidez , mantendo o espectador sempre inquieto gra√ßas aos obst√°culos cada vez mais amea√ßadores enfrentados por aqueles homens .
Equivalente cinematogr√°fico de una bomba de tiempo , la pel√≠cula luce como un thriller de suspenso extremo ambientado en la guerra de Irak . Adrenalina pura , sin cuestionamientos morales y con excelente elenco .
A tough war picture in the tabloid journalist tradition of Sam Fuller , The Hurt Locker avoids most of the sentimentalizing and editorializing of other recent films about Iraq .
The film opens with a quote from Chris Hedges saying that war is a drug . ... The film makes that quite clear , but I am not sure it says a whole lot more than that .
The script 's authenticity and director Kathryn Bigelow 's cinema verit√© style pull us into the film with a mixture of awe and terror .
The Hurt Locker is a frequently gripping film that contains some terrifically detailed sequences ; not only depicting the process of defusing bombs but also depicting just how complex the act of targeting and firing a gun can be .
-LSB- R -RSB- iveting but not ` exciting , ' not in the sense that action movies have taught us to get turned on by the foreplay of countdowns and the climax of explosions ...
With such an able cast and crew , director Kathryn Bigelow had everything she needed to come up with a defining war movie for the 21st century .
What the great Kathryn 's film accomplishes in its own starkly intelligent way , however , is to make the token war is hell argument , but through the filtered lens of a superior B action movie , her forte .
most startling of all the film 's accomplishments is how it approximates the soldiers ' feeling of utter anxiety as they fight a war on foreign soil
Obligatoria . Dura y capaz de tenernos con el est√≥mago encogido en la butaca durante casi toda la pel√≠cula , se trata de una de esas que nadie deber√≠a perderse .
Criticism that Bigelow and Boal 's relentless focus on the feverish intensity of living with constant danger and the rush that comes from beating the odds is as misguided as reading the movie 's `` war is a drug '' tagline as an endorsement : The Hurt Locker is
Bigelow displays a fine Hitchcockian skill set , but her politics are muddy-headed at best .

`` The Hurt Locker '' is not only one of the very best films of 2009 , it is one of the very best and most exciting war movies of any kind to come along in a long time .
The Hurt Locker is an extraordinarily uncomfortable movie to watch , not because it is poorly made , but because it places its audience directly in the crosshairs of hell .
These are just men doing their jobs in an unforgiving workplace , and Bigelow , more than anything , is interested in how they do it , because the how is the difference between going home at the end of the rotation in one piece or not .

A small but muscular combat classic .
If you 're a cinematic thrill-seeker , this portrayal of the real deal is just the fix you 've been looking for .
A movie that deserves to stand as one of the defining films of the decade .

In the end , Bigelow 's point of view is what 's most interesting about The Hurt Locker . The picture 's strength lies in the details she focuses on .

One of the best films of 2009 , and one of the better films made in the past few decades about the men and women who serve in the US military .

It 's dysfunctional , but strangely affirming .
The first great film about the war in Iraq .
The characters are fictional , but writer Mark Boal spent time in Iraq following soldiers who really do this , and the film never feels anything less than authentic .
A brilliant and emotionally powerful war flick .
The director , Kathryn Bigelow , shot with four lightweight cameras , and the imagery is rarely still . The jitteriness is appropriate for a world where everything can suddenly blow to smithereens .
The Hurt Locker is so taut , and skillfully focused on character , that it could be retro-engineered into a stageplay and still retain most of its dramatic punch .
When it comes to getting an audience 's attention , there 's nothing quite like blowing up a major star within the first five minutes of a movie .
Offers a fresh take on the war and the men in it .
If The Hurt Locker is not the best action movie of the summer , I 'll blow up my car .

This is a must see film .
... this is without a doubt director Kathryn Bigelow 's best film to date , one which should be Oscar nominated in every category it 's eligible for .
For the first hour or more , The Hurt Locker boldly forsakes any conventional narrative hook beyond the ongoing tensions between these men and the terrifying grind of defusing bombs day after day .
The kind of uncompromising movie that any politician who claims to support the troops while extending the war and cutting funds for veterans ' benefits -LRB- or any chickenhawk pundit who pooh-poohs the ongoing effects of PTSD -RRB- should be forced to see .
Do n't be afraid to dive right in for a harrowing , credible and astonishingly made portrait of bravery and brutality .
understands the key element in modern warfare : chaos reigns supreme .
Departing from archetypes set by WWII and Vietnam movies , Bigelow 's tough-as-nails film develops its own signature . It 's not a message movie , but a tactile experience . It feels gritty , real and current .
Our American love for mavericks is bound to get tied in knots watching James ' cavalier approach to everyone 's death . He 's a hero and a menace .
Hurt Locker is a superb achievement that not only constructs some of the finest suspense set pieces of the year , but manages to find compelling , innovative wartime psychological threads to pull at as well .
More than any recent movie , this has a ` you are there ' feel to it that gives us a flavor of an Iraq we do n't see on the nightly newscasts .
Here 's the Iraq War movie for those who do n't like Iraq War movies .
There is something powerfully convincing about Bigelow 's way of placing the viewer in a situation where death is unpredictable , can come from 360 degrees , and is indiscriminate about who it takes .
So far , the best fiction films about the Iraq War are Nick Bloomfield 's Battle for Haditha , Irwin Winkler 's Home of the Brave and John Moore 's allegorical Flight of the Phoenix remake . It 's sufficient praise to say The Hurt Locker joins that short list .
Instead of setting out to prove a point , it seeks to immerse us in an environment -- something Bigelow does with a conceptual rigor usually associated with those directors whose work is confined to film societies and art houses .
Its insights and reach extend far beyond what 's happened there over the past several years .
A brilliantly realized character-driven thriller likely to leave a lasting impression and make you completely forget everything you thought you knew about the day-to-day lives of soldiers in Iraq .
The Hurt Locker is a small classic of tension , bravery , and fear , which will be studied twenty years from now when people want to understand something of what happened to American soldiers in Iraq .
The Hurt Locker might be the first Iraq-set film to break through to a mass audience because it does n't lead with the paralysis of the guilt-ridden Yank . The horror is there , but under the rush .
A coolly elegant kineticist , Kathryn Bigelow specializes in impressionistic phallus jostles .
Harrowing and horrifying , The Hurt Locker delivers the visceral , heart-in-throat action goods , and in doing so , gets at more truths about Iraq than its preachy ... brethren .
There 's more tension in this gripping tale than in the waistband of Oprah 's skinny jeans ... which is pretty freakin ' tense .
The film supports the idea that extended exposure to certain kinds of experiences have the effect of either galvanizing a participant or breaking them , if they are fortunate enough to survive . In WWII , war was hell , in Viet Nam it was numbed by drugs , but
An intense , action-driven war pic , a muscular , efficient standout that
simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within as well as what it looks like on the ground .
After some disappointing films , the gifted Bigelow puts to excellent use her strongest skills in this thrillingly kinetic , tightly-focused , utterly compelling portrait of one bomb squad , a highlight of a weak cycle thus far of Iraq war movies .
A wrenching rush of adrenaline set in a never-ending cycle of occupation and struggle and ever-increasing tension .
The Hurt Locker is a near-perfect movie about men in war , men at work . Through sturdy imagery and violent action , it says that even Hell needs heroes .
I 'm not sure this is a film that will be easy to sell to the general public , but anyone who is willing to test themselves will find that it 's a dynamic and memorable experience .
Bigelow and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd crank up the tension to nail-biting , gut-churning extremes and the mayhem is powerfully visceral .
The Hurt Locker probably is n't the ` great ' Iraq film which will finally move audiences into theatres but it does play out like fragments of one .
The Hurt Locker looks and feels like a terrific action film , but there 's a piece of art ticking away within it that goes off inside your head and your heart while you 're watching .
... uncommonly taut and uniformly well acted ...
Tensely action-packed and muscularly directed by Kathryn Bigelow , this tale of an elite U.S. army bomb disposal unit in Baghdad is a familiar story in new clothes , targeted at the young male demographic .
Often gripping at a straight thriller level , but increasingly weakened by its fuzzy psychology , Kathryn Bigelow 's The Hurt Locker does n't bring anything new to the table of grunts-in-the-firing-line movies .

@highlight

A well-acted , intensely shot , action filled war epic , Kathryn Bigelow 's The Hurt Locker is thus far the best of the recent dramatizations of the Iraq War .
