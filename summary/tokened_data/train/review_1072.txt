Succeeds in being passable romance comedy entertainment .
Designed as an ultimate revenge fantasy `` John Tucker Must Die '' is a moderately funny teen comedy with a few flashes of bawdy humor .
Rarely has a title promised so much , and delivered so little . John Tucker Must Die is toothless , gormless , witless , and , worst of all , deathless .
A high-school revenge comedy that aims at a teen audience yet manages to be witty without being snarky or sophomoric .
Betty Thomas 's sloppy storytelling and comic incompetence can be forgiven but to portray young women as flighty airheads obsessed with boys over all else is downright offensive .
Buoyed by its good looking cast and entertaining script , John Tucker Must Die is witty and funny , as it reminds us that it is cool to be yourself - whoever you are .
Had it mined edgier territory and stuck to its guns , it would 've proven a more engaging vehicle than the mild laugher we have here
A load of formulaic nonsense that should still turn a few young heads thanks to its fantasy plot and Jesse Metcalfe 's chest .

Criticizing a summer teen movie for not being high art is like yelling at a sociopath for being a serial killer .
Tucker is strictly for the teen crowd , but the intermittent waves of witty fun are to die for .
When we have savvy , smart TV shows like Veronica Mars , which perfectly and cleverly capture the angst and tribulations of high school life , there 's absolutely no need for empty-headed , vapid movies like this .
This is one of those films that manages to overcome the limitations of it 's genre and become something a bit more .
The material is often trite , but director Thomas and her attractive cast make it seem fresh most of the time .
If we 're going to abandon any sense of storytelling or intelligence , could n't we at the very least do it with cheerful cardboard cutouts ? Nice people can be dumb too .
very slight ... predictable
An out-of-touch and insincere teen product .
Cliche ridden and bland
Its storyline is very predictable and clich√© but teen girls will no doubt have a good time with this movie anyway . Parents on the other hand -LRB- especially dads out there -RRB- , who get stuck in theater with their kids , may want to bring a flask with them to help

Bless her heart , but Thomas is a 58 year-old director making a movie that is meant for tween slumber parties . It 's an uphill battle she ca n't fight in good faith , leaving Tucker a dreary , autopilot directing job .
The direction by Betty Thomas is snappy and bright ... -LRB- but -RRB- the film lacks the nerve for any genuinely nasty fun or comic bite .

There is exactly one worthwhile sequence in the movie , the bit where the trio slip him a bottle of estrogen pills before a game , transforming him into a distraught , emotionally unstable crybaby .
