Culkin looks really bored . Maybe because `` Richie Rich '' is so damn boring .
Serviceable family entertainment .
Decently crafted but oddly charmless .
Unendurable .
Plays on every kid 's fantasy of being so wealthy that no one likes him .
It was fun for what it was ... which is not very much , but hey ... kids will get a kick out of it for all the fun gadgets .
Most of the time , Richie Rich is too busy oohing and ahhing over the junk that money can buy to relax and have a good time .
It 's only worth dreaming , `` If I Were a Rich Boy '' ...
What 's sort of wonderful is the way this movie takes that old formula and makes it fresh and new , with actors who give it wit and charm .
The filmmakers seem to think of their movie as a fiduciary fable , but they 're not quite sure about its moral .
There 's absolutely nothing here you have n't seen before , and while some kids might be mildly entertained , they would probably be even happier just staying home .
Be careful about taking kids under 7 or 8 as it may scare them .
Anyone out there who is still a Macaulay Culkin fan after this one is downright masochistic .
A spirited and fluffy kids ' comedy .








@highlight

With Macaulay Culkin barely registering any emotion , Richie Rich feels disjointed and free of a sense of fun and wonderment .
