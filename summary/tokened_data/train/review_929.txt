-LSB- Di Gregorio -RSB- draws wonderfully unfussy performances from his nonprofessional cast and ... produces a film which feels so natural that it seems to be capturing real life
An Italian comedy so slight it practically evaporates ...
Mid-August Lunch is a sweet-spirited gem , warmly comic while showing the hassles of caring for aging relatives more honestly than 10 family sagas from Hollywood .
Charming but insignificant .
It was easy to drink down and pleasure to eat up , and while it did n't blow my mind or rock my world it left me fully satiated to the point I hungered not a single ounce more .
Not much happens in this wisp of a movie -LRB- it 's barely 75 minutes -RRB- , and not much is necessary ; it 's all about finding a mood and letting it sneak up and envelop the watcher .
Easy as a Sunday morning ...
A tasty tidbit of a film , Mid-August Lunch is one of those movies where almost nothing happens but it happens quite nicely .
As shimmering and insubstantial as heat haze ... an airy morsel that dissolves on the tongue , imparting only the faintest hint of flavor .
If Mid-August Lunch were a meal instead of a movie , it would be something light and quick , but not entirely unsatisfying . A green salad with a couple pieces of grilled shrimp on top , say .
You 'd have trouble finding another movie with such unforced appreciation of its elderly characters or such intelligent understanding of old age .
A delightful homage to the simple pleasures that life can offer no matter the age .
The droll Mid-August is a tribute to the gentle skills of Italian filmmaker Gianni Di Gregorio , who not only wrote and directed this unhurried chamber piece but also starred in it as a character he named after himself .
There 's no grand drama or payoff to sleepy Italian import Mid-August Lunch -- this is essentially Polaroid-type , snapshot cinema . But there is truth here , and in truth there is always some value .

No one seems to have a clue about how to inject life into lifeless material ... a cinematic meal of soft , bland fare only .
The movie glows .
It 's like watching John Cassavetes trapped in a mega-episode of The Golden Girls .
The only whiff of passion comes from the sadistic care that has gone into putting garish clothes and makeup on the mother , which give her the ghoulish air of Jeanne Moreau in a fun-house mirror .
Feels more like an unsatisfactory appetizer than a satisfying main course .
In just 75 minutes the director convinces us that girls just want to have fun -- even when they 're 90 .

Warm-hearted , subtle Italian comedy with likeable characters and an important message , though it does occasionally feel like a sketch that 's going on too long .
For every scene in which the old dears ' twinkly-eyed feistiness becomes a bit clich√©d , there is another that gives a perceptive , touching view of these women 's lives .
A wonderfully patient , delicately observed film ; warm , generous , never for a moment sentimental or patronising , never exploiting dottiness and eccentricity .
The semi-improvised performances and gently nostalgic tone makes this endearing and captivating .
Underlying this amiable , thoughtful film is an assumption that age should bring with it respect - and however exasperated he gets , Gianni abides by this code completely .
Di Gregorio 's directorial debut is an unpretentious delight . It may be small in scale but it 's also warm-hearted , amusing and observant , and features endearing performances from its ensemble cast .
The beauty of this picture is that it does n't shy away from depicting the indignities of growing old - not the least of which is that none of your children wants to look after you - and yet manages to invest all of its elderly characters with dignity .
Mid-August Lunch is a film of rare benevolence that treats its subjects with dignity and playfulness .
Elegantly shot , and with a terrific tango-infused score , this is a quiet gem .
As single joke movies go , this droll , happy-go-lucky miniature from writer/director/actor Gianni Di Gregorio is easily one of the better ones .
Appealingly acted by a mostly non-professional cast and propelled by a moving score , Mid-August Lunch proves how small can indeed be beautiful .
The film is full of natural comedy ; his women could easily have been comic harridans , but they are too fully drawn , perhaps because the director allowed them to draw themselves .

-LSB- An -RSB- exquisite , coralled miniature .
It is a gentle wisp of a charmer that never overstays its warm welcome .
