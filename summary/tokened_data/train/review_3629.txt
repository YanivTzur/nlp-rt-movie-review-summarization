Though Paris , Texas is the most interesting American film I 've seen all year , it is finally not a success .
... this vision of America is one of vast landscapes and fluorescent signs , the latter being almost as visually poetic as the former .
The acting , Robby MÃ¼ller cinematography , music and tone carry the day ...
-LSB- VIDEO ESSAY -RSB- Written by Sam Shepherd , and adapted by L.M. Kit Carson , the linear story for `` Paris , Texas '' contains the hallmarks of Shepherd 's characteristic dramatic themes ...
one of Wenders 's best films , a stirring portrait of people striving against their disconnect that resists simple answers even as it rewards our emotional investment .
One of the few films that has captured the beauty of the American southwest in all its rolling desert glory .
Paris , Texas may be missing a crucial piece of authentic Americana , but it still evokes an America most Americans yearn to gaze on .
... the mix of -LSB- Wim -RSB- Wenders ' sensibilities and love of American movies and Sam Shepard 's spare writing and take on fractured American families creates a sublime vision .
Deservedly winning Cannes Fest top award , Wim Wenders ' brilliant film is a personal meditation on the relative power of images and words , as well as a contribution to the modern Western and journey pictures as uniguely American genres .
the evolution of a dream
Compelling contemporary Western .
Paris , Texas is that rare thing : a movie of intelligence and beauty and poetry , but also based on emotionally believable characters and a forward-moving , narrative thrust .
Paris , Texas uses the familiar thematic construct of the Western , and is conducted in somber nostalgia .
A quirky movie about the surprise of selfless love .
Wenders ' slow , moody style is n't for everyone , but this is the epitome of it
















@highlight

A quiet yet deeply moving kind of Western , Paris , Texas captures a place and people like never before -LRB- or after -RRB- .
