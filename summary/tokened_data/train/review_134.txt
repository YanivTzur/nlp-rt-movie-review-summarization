Like porn itself , reaction will vary .
Gordon Levitt , also the author of the script , is terribly funny ... -LSB- Full review in Spanish -RSB-
Gordon-Levitt 's more modest aims help the last act 's moralizing go down smoother than Steve McQueen 's tongue-clucking opus , but only just .
Don Jon is breezy , provocative and definitely makes for an interesting discourse of sex and relationships . Check it out .
As a simple and sweet coming-of-age story for the Jersey Shore generation , it 's perfectly entertaining stuff .
He 's got a good ear for guy-talk dialogue , and a welcome sense of candor-he 's putting some stuff out there about guys and porn . As a director , he 's got a keen visual wit ; the film has a fast , popping montage style that recalls early Aronofsky .
In terms of disposable , enjoyable entertainment , you could do much worse than this .
In this raunchy , foul-mouthed and candid comedy about male narcissism , Gordon-Levitt _ perhaps best remembered as Leonardo DiCaprio 's sidekick in Inception _ gives us a sure-footed directorial debut .
The only trouble with Don Jon is the film 's comfort level with the kind of material that holds its hero enslaved .
There 's just enough charm and poignancy here to make it worth a watch . Not a bad start for any first-time filmmaker .
A barn-door broad burlesque of Joisey stereotypes and holy-cannoli accents . It 's Saturday Night Fever drawn in crayon .
It 's in movies like the ribald but surprisingly endearing sex comedy Don Jon that Gordon-Levitt has connected best with audiences .
Don Jon is no kind of resonating masterpiece , but it 's intelligent , thoughtful , funny , and dedicated to the cause of finding a personality and sticking with him through the excess of his addictions .
Thankfully , the women of the film are what save the movie , bringing something fresh to the table-for Jon , a chance at lasting love , and for us , some seasoned comic chops .
Wondering what exactly is revealed as a cure to Don Jon 's addiction ? Why , good sex , of course ! Thanks , geniuses !
Gordon-Levitt is on top form , as is Johansson as the type of girl who only takes her gum out to eat .
Gordon-Levitt 's confidence is appealing , even if the film itself mistakes redundancy for profundity .
The messages of the film are stark and genuine , much more so than one might expect having seen the promotional material .
A thoughtful , original and provocative feature-length directorial debut from Joseph Gordon-Levitt .
It gets harder and harder to support this passion for porn .
A film that should be compulsory viewing for all preteens , sexual content be damned , as it may just save them a lifetime of disappointment .
The entire movie seems to recalibrate and rebalance itself around -LSB- Moore -RSB- , shifting convincingly into something more than a surface-heavy evocation of sterile on-screen onanism .
Alas , I did n't buy a word of it .
The end is satisfaction enough to justify the initially explicit means .
There 's little here to care for or about : what promises to be a friskier version of Shame winds up closer to a Very Special Episode of Jersey Shore .
This certainly wo n't find a mainstream audience but it is fresh , well executed and entertaining .
Despite a contrived and sentimental ending , this is an entertaining riff on men and fantasy .
It 's refreshing to see a movie so visually undemonstrative .
Starts mischievous and moves into maudlin .
With this writing-directing debut , Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a remarkably assured comedy-drama while also giving himself a role that 's far against his usual type .
A minor triumph that manages to raise some big laughs while delivering a thought-provoking message .
A superbly acted and sporadically amusing character study , but it 's let down by an overly repetitive script , painfully underwritten female characters and a lack of chemistry between Gordon-Levitt , Johansson and Moore .
In a bravura performance , Gordon-Levitt sleazily revels in the role of bad boy ... but it 's a character undistinguished by light or shade and becomes wearing , a sex drive that ends up a cul-de-sac .
These are caricatures rather than characters , and neither Levitt nor Moore ever quite lock step with the film 's snappy sitcom tone .
The naff accents and exaggerated mannerisms become very tiring over 90 minutes .
The work of a young director reaching to impress without having fully formed ideas ...
As a director , Gordon-Levitt demonstrates considerable technical flair through stylistic flourishes and coaxes great performances out of his co-stars .
A lively , savvy film with some great performances from some surprising quarters .
Smart , witty and more than a little melancholy , Don Jon is a fist-pumping success .
Though Don Jon succeeds in being funny at every turn , it is less successful in being a movie with something important to say .
a fascinating and often compelling film , and a clear sign that Gordon-Levitt is a filmmaker of note whose future is bright if he continues to not play it safe

Before it flies off the rails in the final act , Joseph Gordon-Levitt 's first self-penned , self-directed star vehicle , Don Jon , is an uncommonly provocative spin on familiar rom-com tropes .
This is the kind of American movie that comes along far too rarely . It 's funny and entertaining , but it remembers who we are as human beings , does not shy away from our many flaws , and finds something endearing in all of it .
The biggest problem is Jon . He 's unlikable from the start and never improves .
Never before has Gordon-Levitt disappeared into character as he does here .
Brave , bold and bone rattling , Gordon-Levitt 's Don Jon makes for a bumpy -- but undeniably satisfying -- cinematic ride to the dark side , and back .

At least 80 % of it is snappy , droll fluff , while the other 20 % is what you get when you persuade Julianne Moore to be in your movie : in a word , better .
One of the best of the year .
Don Jon humanizes the Jersey Shore type by burying itself beneath the muscles and hair gel with a story about learning how to connect with another human being .
Gordon-Levitt 's characters feel real and `` Don Jon '' is a convincing , authentic , funny , modern romance .
Hearing the star of `` Who 's the Boss ? '' drop about 500 f-bombs is one of the film 's few pleasures .
Really , `` Don Jon '' could have - should have - gone on another 20 minutes . Then again , when was the last time you felt that about a romantic comedy ? Or any movie ?
Funny at times and touches on some interesting issues . But the Jersey caricature is so embarrassing that it ultimately sinks the film .
The movie has a keen understanding of how easily we can hurt other people by not considering them .
Who would have thought one of the most amusing and oddly insightful romantic comedies would be built around the power and the potent pull of porn ?
Irreverent romcom about porn is insightful but very graphic .
GTL comparisons aside , Jon 's sublime journey extends well past the shenanigans along The Jersey Shore 's old boardwalk .
Smart , funny , contemporary and sharply made .

The movie takes a roundhouse punch at male shallowness , but Jon , in and out of his clothes , is not an interesting enough man to be emblematic of anything .
The movie is a broad ethnic comedy , but there 's nothing broad about the wicked-smart way it 's executed . Even long-played-out stereotypes take on new life .
