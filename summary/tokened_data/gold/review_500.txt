Both the film and the book retain the echoing emptiness of a self-published work , a feeling that this is a one-dimensional vanity project produced without the benefit of an editor or censor or any corrective balance .
While it is certainly a respectable work , it operates solely on a restrained emotional level . In the end , Still Alice somehow avoids a real confrontation with its own materials , giving us instead a disguised form of sentimentality .
The film is lifted by one of the few actresses out there who can make even the blankest of despair feel entirely fresh .
If only the film itself were worthy of Moore 's work .
Moore 's performance as a well-to-do woman stricken with Alzheimer 's before her time redeems Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland 's cringe-drama Still Alice .
What works beyond a shadow of a doubt is Julianne Moore herself . For a long time now , she has demonstrated an uncanny range and power .
In Still Alice , we witness a woman who is waving and drowning . It is her fate . It is who she is . Moore makes watching her struggle a rare , if wrenching , privilege .
Still Alice is a close-to-heartbreaking portrait of mental illness and a genuinely effecting character study .
She captures Alice 's distintegration with magisterial precision-the confusion , panic , anger , and heroic resolve to still be herself-and does it all without ever pleading for our sympathy .
Polished but forgettable .
It 's the intent of this moving film to capture something that for obvious reasons is rarely attempted in memoir or movie , i.e. , the experience of the deadly disease from the perspective of the sufferer rather than the caregivers .
The performances prevent the film from becoming totally generic .
Kristen Stewart , fresh off the weird festival entry Clouds of Sils Maria with Juliette Binoche , is just as good here as ultimately the only unselfish member of this disappointing family . But come and stay for Moore , an actor for this and all ages .
70 percent portrait of a disease/30 percent family drama , recommended as preparation/demystification for Alzheimer 's - affected families , and for fans of both Moore and Stewart .
-LSB- Moore gives a -RSB- delicate performance here as a strong woman struggling not to be reduced to pity .
The syrupy score just adds to the cheesiness of what is a classy disease-of-the-week weepie .
The drama offers little new to the `` disease drama '' genre but the whole film is lifted thanks to Moore .
-LSB- Julianne Moore -RSB- delivers a brilliant performance that buoys Still Alice just when it seems too much to bear . Oscar is waiting in the wings .
While Still Alice occasionally overstates , relies on its melancholy soundtrack or those home movie-style flashbacks , it can also be delicate , even brilliant .
Despite Moore 's fine work , Still Alice comes across as one of those old made-for-TV , disease of the week movies .
Still Alice is not an easy film to watch , but it is a movie well worth seeing .
More sincere than convincing , Still Alice is the rare picture that earns plaudits for its star dimming , not glowing . In a real sense , Moore gradually disappears from her own movie .
It does have a predictable trajectory -- how could it not ? -- but it 's certainly not movie-of-the-week fare .
This is one of Moore 's defining performances , and it is a brave one .
The finely nuanced script takes a sensitive look at this disease and its effects , not only on the person afflicted , but also on family members who have to deal with it .
A very fine screenplay based on a novel written by a neuroscience researcher with a PhD from Harvard who obviously knew the territory , including the life-style of its mandarin lead character toppled by Alzheimers .
It 's the kind of performance that does n't just support a film , it gives the film its breath of life .
It 's a quietly harrowing portrait of a family losing the woman they know -- and a woman losing herself .
While the relationship between Moore and Stewart 's characters is interesting , most of the film follows well-traveled roads .
It uses enormous and expressive tricks for obvious but fairly effective external signs for subjectivity in the story . -LSB- full review in Spanish -RSB-
Julianne Moore shows us that she is still in her prime , playing to every subtle nuance of the degenerative disease with precision and respect .
Julianne Moore 's terror at watching her own emotional and intellectual life slip away is palpable , and much scarier to me than any slasher movie .
Not only are there not enough good , smart roles for women , the movies that do contain those roles are too often one-dimensional .
Still Alice certainly has a superb lead performance in Julianne Moore , but directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland focus more on the situation than the story .
The older you are , the more sensitive and receptive to the script 's somber material you will likely be .
-LSB- Moore 's -RSB- performance here as the deteriorating Alice is restrained and analytical in a way that allows us to see through her eyes .
The subject matter may be tough , and the end-point inevitable , but the message we take away is defiant and ultimately uplifting .
We 're all familiar with the Hollywood clich√© that playing a character with a disease or disability is an attention-grabbing ploy for Oscar glory , but what is remarkable about Julianne Moore 's performance is just how subtle and un-showy it is .
Writer-directors Glatzer and Westmoreland have written a rich , multi-layered screenplay that works equally well as family melodrama and as a meditation on language , identity and mortality .
When it 's not fending off an attack of the glums , Still Alice comes down with a big case of the prims .
Never once veering into heavy-handed sentimentality , it 's a film to break your heart .
While Moore has deserved an Academy Award for years ... the surprise is Stewart , who has left the twilight zone and burst forth as a creature of brutal honesty on screen .
The material has n't been properly reimagined for cinema .
Co-directors Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer keep the film simple and straightforward , cutting to the core of the matter without the need to tug at the heartstrings .
Moore plays the descent into dementia with notable subtlety . There 's no grandstanding .
The reality of Alzheimer 's may be even harsher than its presentation here but that would surely make a film that would only dismay its viewers .
Still Alice is unquestionably well researched and sincere in its intentions , but at times it feels a little schematic .
-LSB- Moore -RSB- almost carries the film beyond disease-of-the-week blandness , but both Sarah Polley 's Away from Her and Michael Haneke 's Amour mined deeper and more surprising material from the familial fallout .
Heartbreaking and convincingly told it may be , Still Alice only hints at the desperation the disease leads to , shying away from depicting the true horror of Alzheimer 's .
Moore 's own face starts to become as bare a cupboard as her mind . It 's more than the no-make-up look . First , lines of doubt and fear map her face . Then starts to come a blankness like infantilism .
Julianne Moore gives the performance of her career -LRB- no mean feat , given the strength of her previous work -RRB- in this heartbreaking yet life-affirming tale of a woman determined to hold onto her identity while under attack from a debilitating mental disease .
An absorbing portrait of one woman 's interior landscape .
This is an affecting and thoroughly worthwhile film on a very contemporary topic - with some Larkinian reflections on what will and wo n't survive of us .
... a performance beautifully coloured with varying shades of emotion that also makes clever use of -LSB- Moore 's -RSB- porcelain looks to evoke the vulnerability of the eponymous Alice .
Moore gives a controlled portrait of emotional implosion ...
Moore is the real reason Still Alice works . She 's so natural and free of vanity . She does n't telegraph the tragedy of her situation . It 's a quiet performance and the uncertainty of how present Alice is undercuts everything , even the joyful moments .
For my dad , who died of complications from Alzheimer 's . This is the movie that needed to be made .

`` Still Alice '' provides a valuable lesson in empathy and understanding , with a message for all of us in accepting what we 've lost , and celebrating what has n't yet gone .
The film is hobbled by a naff , TV-movie aesthetic and jarringly mawkish score . Yet Moore gives us raw heartache , running the gauntlet from fear to fury to powerless frustration , before she 's barely there at all .
At times -LRB- Moore 's -RRB- subtleties feel like a rebellion against the potentially cheesy directions taken by the screenplay .
Julianne Moore 's Oscar clip will likely be an instance of high drama . But she 's at her best during the still moments in between .

Julianne Moore is n't merely good in the lead role . She 's devastatingly , heartbreakingly good , and she 's a big reason why Still Alice is as moving as it is .
