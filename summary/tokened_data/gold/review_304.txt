Boasts a killer premise and better than average acting , so it 's all the more disappointing that Anderson proves unable to avoid annoying horror movie pitfalls .
Immediate frights and long-lasting dread are still not quite enough
Hop aboard this Shuttle if you 're in the mood for one unsettling ride .
The characters are aggressive and mostly smart , the villain is fearsome and hateful , and the premise -LRB- ` An airport shuttle ride descends into darkness ' -RRB- is brilliantly simple .
Well conceived thriller , Shuttle takes the familiar situation and develops it into terrifying ordeal
Shuttle could have worked but it is so bogged down with clich√©s and predictable twists that it comes apart at its illogical seams .
The film is an efficiently engineered mechanism for creating suspense .
When the payoff finally arrives , it seems tasteless not just because of its topicality , but because the shock feels unearned .
There is no release for the audience , no ` entertainment , ' not even much action excitement . Just a remorseless march into the dark .
A slightly prosaic and tedious , but mostly chilly and intense ride .
Shuttle mostly exists , in the words of Alfred Hitchcock , to ` put the audience through it , ' but it leaves you in a very different place than where it started and with remarkable economy of effort .
Instead of suspense , we get frustration at the stupidity of the characters .
Shuttle is a grim and twisted exercise in high-stress terror that falls just short of the torture-porn subgenre .
a pile of stinking turpitude
One hell of a terrifying ride ...
Anderson focuses entirely on cat-and-mouse capers , while failing to reflect in any serious way upon the real-world issues that his plot exploits , so the end result is a disappointingly empty exercise in genre .
Solid , effective and perfect for date night .
If you step aboard Shuttle , be prepared for one heck of a ride filled with suspense , action and ever-escalating terror . With this ingenious thriller , Edward Anderson , who wrote the heist flick Flawless , makes an audacious directorial debut .
Nasty and dumb , a lot like Hostel without the extreme torture and gore .
Next time , spring for a cab .
A decently twisty indie thriller about hostages lured aboard an airport minivan whose destination is nowhere pleasant .



@highlight

While this debut by Edward Anderson is economical and occasionally effective , Shuttle offers little catharsis after its tense ride .
