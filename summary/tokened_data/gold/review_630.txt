A film about resistance , passion and the determined reclamation of cultural space , Paris Is Burning has been tremendously influential , and is essential viewing for any student of the issues it concerns or of the documentary form .
Livingston 's film is a poignant look at black and Latinx gay and transgender communities , dissecting race and class , gender and sexuality .
The directness and honesty of moment after moment strike back at peppily ` cheerful ' white America 's model-world . Blazes forth the importance , for a marginalized community , of adopting a fervid , fiery attitude all its own .
One emerges from this film not only with a new vocabulary and a fresh way of viewing the straight world but with a bracing object lesson in understanding what society `` role models '' are all about .
Livingston is smart enough to realize that her subjects are best equipped to explain themselves .
This landmark docu celebrates the resourcefulness of a group that 's subcultural but not truly countercultural -- its denizens long to become members of the society they imitate , operating at its periphery .
The beauty of the film is Livingston 's nonjudgmental , accommodating camera .
