This is probably Redford 's most complex and cleverly structured directorial effort .
Pokes gently at the funny bone and is sympathetic without becoming sentimental .
Redford and company have put a quirky twist on the material , investing it with a quasi-mystical aspect as well as some raw comedy .
Fairly choked with good intentions , whimsy , touches of fantasy , and cardboard liberal stereotypes .
Redford 's film sustains a slow mood of simpatico amiability and photographs the landscape with moony or golden washes that are perhaps hard to dislike , but is slain by its adherence to an outdated populist mythology .
Who 'd of thought that a battle over water rights would make for such an interesting tale ?
Not good . Not bad . Just there .
Forgotten little gem from Robert Redford
The film is very big on sunsets and sunrises . It also has a touristy appreciation for all manner of things folkloric . What it does n't have is dramatic coherence or backbone .
Picaresque tale set in a small Hispanic town where a developer 's idea of progress threatens to change the community completely .
If Redford had left out a few of the waffling , undecided characters and drawn his dramatic lines more strongly , the film might have been a lot more powerful .
Redford and his crack cast of familiar gringos and less-familiar locals had an infectiously good time making it .
Corny , you bet . But that 's to be admired in an old war horse on the last frontier .
The simple fact is that despite its flaws Milagro is still a very pleasant outing , loaded with delightful characters and a great many very enjoyable set-pieces .

Arguably Robert Redford 's most inchoate work , The Milagro Beanfield War has plenty of beautiful moments , but they do n't quite add up to a worthwhile whole .
