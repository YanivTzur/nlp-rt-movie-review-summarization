deliver us from evil is a superb documentary and a searing look at an institution protecting its leaders at the expense of its followers . a profoundly disturbing chronicle of a wolf in sheep 's clothing , the film builds a clear-eyed case against pedophile priest oliver o'grady , and the catholic bureaucracy that protected him . the recollections of o'grady 's victims are nothing short of shocking and heartbreaking .
