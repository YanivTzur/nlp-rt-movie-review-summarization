written by a teenager -lrb- and it shows -rrb- , eragon presents nothing new to the `` hero 's journey '' story archetype . in movie terms , this movie looks and sounds like lord of the rings and plays out like a bad star wars rip-off . the movie spins the tale of a peasant boy who is suddenly entrusted with a dragon and must , with the help of a mentor , train , grow strong , and defeat an evil emperor . the way the critics picture it , the makers of eragon should soon be expecting an annoyed phone call from george lucas .
