just my luck is a screwball rom-com that fails to take advantage of lindsay lohan 's considerable charm . the film -lrb- along with robert altman 's a prairie home companion -rrb- marks the end of lohan 's teen queen phase as she begins playing characters that are older , but not necessarily wiser . lohan 's character is supposedly cursed with bad luck , though the movie confuses misfortune with plain stupidity , leading lohan into a long series of silly and senseless physical gags .
